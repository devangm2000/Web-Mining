[ 1 ] Data mining interdisciplinary subfield computer science statistics overall goal extract information ( intelligent methods ) data set transform information comprehensible structure use . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Data mining analysis step `` knowledge discovery databases '' process , KDD . [ 5 ] Aside raw analysis step , also involves database data management aspects , data pre-processing , model inference considerations , interestingness metrics , complexity considerations , post-processing discovered structures , visualization , online updating . [ 1 ] The term `` data mining '' misnomer , goal extraction patterns knowledge large amounts data , extraction ( mining ) data . [ 6 ] It also buzzword [ 7 ] frequently applied form large-scale data information processing ( collection , extraction , warehousing , analysis , statistics ) well application computer decision support system , including artificial intelligence ( e.g. , machine learning ) business intelligence . The book Data mining : Practical machine learning tools techniques Java [ 8 ] ( covers mostly machine learning material ) originally named Practical machine learning , term data mining added marketing reasons . [ 9 ] Often general terms ( large scale ) data analysis analytics—or , referring actual methods , artificial intelligence machine learning—are appropriate . The actual data mining task semi-automatic automatic analysis large quantities data extract previously unknown , interesting patterns groups data records ( cluster analysis ) , unusual records ( anomaly detection ) , dependencies ( association rule mining , sequential pattern mining ) . This usually involves using database techniques spatial indices . These patterns seen kind summary input data , may used analysis , example , machine learning predictive analytics . For example , data mining step might identify multiple groups data , used obtain accurate prediction results decision support system . Neither data collection , data preparation , result interpretation reporting part data mining step , belong overall KDD process additional steps . The difference data analysis data mining data analysis used test models hypotheses dataset , e.g. , analyzing effectiveness marketing campaign , regardless amount data ; contrast , data mining uses machine learning statistical models uncover clandestine hidden patterns large volume data . [ 10 ] The related terms data dredging , data fishing , data snooping refer use data mining methods sample parts larger population data set ( may ) small reliable statistical inferences made validity patterns discovered . These methods , however , used creating new hypotheses test larger data populations .

The term `` data mining '' used similarly critical way economist Michael Lovell article published Review Economic Studies 1983 . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Lovell indicates practice `` masquerades variety aliases , ranging `` experimentation '' ( positive ) `` fishing '' `` snooping '' ( negative ) . The term data mining appeared around 1990 database community , generally positive connotations . For short time 1980s , phrase `` database mining '' ™ , used , since trademarked HNC , San Diego-based company , pitch Database Mining Workstation ; [ 13 ] researchers consequently turned data mining . Other terms used include data archaeology , information harvesting , information discovery , knowledge extraction , etc . Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro coined term `` knowledge discovery databases '' first workshop topic ( KDD-1989 ) term became popular AI machine learning community . However , term data mining became popular business press communities . [ 14 ] Currently , terms data mining knowledge discovery used interchangeably . In academic community , major forums research started 1995 First International Conference Data Mining Knowledge Discovery ( KDD-95 ) started Montreal AAAI sponsorship . It co-chaired Usama Fayyad Ramasamy Uthurusamy . A year later , 1996 , Usama Fayyad launched journal Kluwer called Data Mining Knowledge Discovery founding editor-in-chief . Later started SIGKDD Newsletter SIGKDD Explorations . [ 15 ] The KDD International conference became primary highest quality conference data mining acceptance rate research paper submissions 18 % . The journal Data Mining Knowledge Discovery primary research journal field . Background [ edit ] The manual extraction patterns data occurred centuries . Early methods identifying patterns data include Bayes ' theorem ( 1700s ) regression analysis ( 1800s ) . The proliferation , ubiquity increasing power computer technology dramatically increased data collection , storage , manipulation ability . As data sets grown size complexity , direct `` hands-on '' data analysis increasingly augmented indirect , automated data processing , aided discoveries computer science , specially field machine learning , neural networks , cluster analysis , genetic algorithms ( 1950s ) , decision trees decision rules ( 1960s ) , support vector machines ( 1990s ) . Data mining process applying methods intention uncovering hidden patterns . [ 16 ] large data sets . It bridges gap applied statistics artificial intelligence ( usually provide mathematical background ) database management exploiting way data stored indexed databases execute actual learning discovery algorithms efficiently , allowing methods applied ever-larger data sets . Process [ edit ] The knowledge discovery databases ( KDD ) process commonly defined stages : Selection Pre-processing Transformation Data mining Interpretation/evaluation . [ 5 ] It exists , however , many variations theme , Cross-industry standard process data mining ( CRISP-DM ) defines six phases : Business understanding Data understanding Data preparation Modeling Evaluation Deployment simplified process ( 1 ) Pre-processing , ( 2 ) Data Mining , ( 3 ) Results Validation . Polls conducted 2002 , 2004 , 2007 2014 show CRISP-DM methodology leading methodology used data miners . [ 17 ] The data mining standard named polls SEMMA . However , 3–4 times many people reported using CRISP-DM . Several teams researchers published reviews data mining process models , [ 18 ] Azevedo Santos conducted comparison CRISP-DM SEMMA 2008 . [ 19 ] Pre-processing [ edit ] Before data mining algorithms used , target data set must assembled . As data mining uncover patterns actually present data , target data set must large enough contain patterns remaining concise enough mined within acceptable time limit . A common source data data mart data warehouse . Pre-processing essential analyze multivariate data sets data mining . The target set cleaned . Data cleaning removes observations containing noise missing data . Data mining [ edit ] Data mining involves six common classes tasks : [ 5 ] Anomaly detection ( outlier/change/deviation detection ) – The identification unusual data records , might interesting data errors require investigation . Association rule learning ( dependency modeling ) – Searches relationships variables . For example , supermarket might gather data customer purchasing habits . Using association rule learning , supermarket determine products frequently bought together use information marketing purposes . This sometimes referred market basket analysis . Clustering – task discovering groups structures data way another `` similar '' , without using known structures data . Classification – task generalizing known structure apply new data . For example , e-mail program might attempt classify e-mail `` legitimate '' `` spam '' . Regression – attempts find function models data least error , estimating relationships among data datasets . Summarization – providing compact representation data set , including visualization report generation . Results validation [ edit ] An example data produced data dredging bot operated statistician Tyler Vigen , apparently showing close link best word winning spelling bee competition number people United States killed venomous spiders . The similarity trends obviously coincidence . Data mining unintentionally misused , produce results appear significant ; actually predict future behavior reproduced new sample data bear little use . Often results investigating many hypotheses performing proper statistical hypothesis testing . A simple version problem machine learning known overfitting , problem arise different phases process thus train/test split—when applicable all—may sufficient prevent happening . [ 20 ] This section missing information non-classification tasks data mining . It covers machine learning . Please expand section include information . Further details may exist talk page . ( September 2011 ) The final step knowledge discovery data verify patterns produced data mining algorithms occur wider data set . Not patterns found data mining algorithms necessarily valid . It common data mining algorithms find patterns training set present general data set . This called overfitting . To overcome , evaluation uses test set data data mining algorithm trained . The learned patterns applied test set , resulting output compared desired output . For example , data mining algorithm trying distinguish `` spam '' `` legitimate '' emails would trained training set sample e-mails . Once trained , learned patterns would applied test set e-mails trained . The accuracy patterns measured many e-mails correctly classify . Several statistical methods may used evaluate algorithm , ROC curves . If learned patterns meet desired standards , subsequently necessary re-evaluate change pre-processing data mining steps . If learned patterns meet desired standards , final step interpret learned patterns turn knowledge . Research [ edit ] The premier professional body field Association Computing Machinery 's ( ACM ) Special Interest Group ( SIG ) Knowledge Discovery Data Mining ( SIGKDD ) . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Since 1989 , ACM SIG hosted annual international conference published proceedings , [ 23 ] since 1999 published biannual academic journal titled `` SIGKDD Explorations '' . [ 24 ] Computer science conferences data mining include : CIKM Conference – ACM Conference Information Knowledge Management European Conference Machine Learning Principles Practice Knowledge Discovery Databases KDD Conference – ACM SIGKDD Conference Knowledge Discovery Data Mining Data mining topics also present many data management/database conferences ICDE Conference , SIGMOD Conference International Conference Very Large Data Bases Standards [ edit ] There efforts define standards data mining process , example , 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process Data Mining ( CRISP-DM 1.0 ) 2004 Java Data Mining standard ( JDM 1.0 ) . Development successors processes ( CRISP-DM 2.0 JDM 2.0 ) active 2006 stalled since . JDM 2.0 withdrawn without reaching final draft . For exchanging extracted models—in particular use predictive analytics—the key standard Predictive Model Markup Language ( PMML ) , XML-based language developed Data Mining Group ( DMG ) supported exchange format many data mining applications . As name suggests , covers prediction models , particular data mining task high importance business applications . However , extensions cover ( example ) subspace clustering proposed independently DMG . [ 25 ] Notable uses [ edit ] Main article : Examples data mining See also : Category : Applied data mining . Data mining used wherever digital data available today . Notable examples data mining found throughout business , medicine , science , surveillance . Privacy concerns ethics [ edit ] While term `` data mining '' may ethical implications , often associated mining information relation peoples ' behavior ( ethical otherwise ) . [ 26 ] The ways data mining used cases contexts raise questions regarding privacy , legality , ethics . [ 27 ] In particular , data mining government commercial data sets national security law enforcement purposes , Total Information Awareness Program ADVISE , raised privacy concerns . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Data mining requires data preparation uncovers information patterns compromise confidentiality privacy obligations . A common way occur data aggregation . Data aggregation involves combining data together ( possibly various sources ) way facilitates analysis ( also might make identification private , individual-level data deducible otherwise apparent ) . [ 30 ] This data mining per se , result preparation data before—and purposes of—the analysis . The threat individual 's privacy comes play data , compiled , cause data miner , anyone access newly compiled data set , able identify specific individuals , especially data originally anonymous . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] It recommended [ according ? ] aware following data collected : [ 30 ] The purpose data collection ( known ) data mining projects ; How data used ; Who able mine data use data derivatives ; The status security surrounding access data ; How collected data updated . Data may also modified become anonymous , individuals may readily identified . [ 30 ] However , even `` anonymized '' data sets potentially contain enough information allow identification individuals , occurred journalists able find several individuals based set search histories inadvertently released AOL . [ 34 ] The inadvertent revelation personally identifiable information leading provider violates Fair Information Practices . This indiscretion cause financial , emotional , bodily harm indicated individual . In one instance privacy violation , patrons Walgreens filed lawsuit company 2011 selling prescription information data mining companies turn provided data pharmaceutical companies . [ 35 ] Situation Europe [ edit ] Europe rather strong privacy laws , efforts underway strengthen rights consumers . However , U.S.–E.U . Safe Harbor Principles , developed 1998 2000 , currently effectively expose European users privacy exploitation U.S. companies . As consequence Edward Snowden 's global surveillance disclosure , increased discussion revoke agreement , particular data fully exposed National Security Agency , attempts reach agreement United States failed . [ 36 ] Situation United States [ edit ] In United States , privacy concerns addressed US Congress via passage regulatory controls Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . The HIPAA requires individuals give `` informed consent '' regarding information provide intended present future uses . According article Biotech Business Week , `` ' [ ] n practice , HIPAA may offer greater protection longstanding regulations research arena , ' says AAHC . More importantly , rule 's goal protection informed consent approach level incomprehensibility average individuals . `` [ 37 ] This underscores necessity data anonymity data aggregation mining practices . U.S. information privacy legislation HIPAA Family Educational Rights Privacy Act ( FERPA ) applies specific areas law addresses . The use data mining majority businesses U.S. controlled legislation . Copyright law [ edit ] Situation Europe [ edit ] Under European copyright database laws , mining in-copyright works ( web mining ) without permission copyright owner legal . Where database pure data Europe , may copyright—but database rights may exist data mining becomes subject intellectual property owners ' rights protected Database Directive . On recommendation Hargreaves review , led UK government amend copyright law 2014 allow content mining limitation exception . [ 38 ] The UK second country world Japan , introduced exception 2009 data mining . However , due restriction Information Society Directive ( 2001 ) , UK exception allows content mining non-commercial purposes . UK copyright law also allow provision overridden contractual terms conditions . The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion text data mining 2013 , title Licences Europe . [ 39 ] The focus solution legal issue , licensing rather limitations exceptions , led representatives universities , researchers , libraries , civil society groups open access publishers leave stakeholder dialogue May 2013 . [ 40 ] Situation United States [ edit ] US copyright law , particular provision fair use , upholds legality content mining America , fair use countries Israel , Taiwan South Korea . As content mining transformative , supplant original work , viewed lawful fair use . For example , part Google Book settlement presiding judge case ruled Google 's digitization project in-copyright books lawful , part transformative uses digitization project displayed—one text data mining .
