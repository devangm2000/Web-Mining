These used make early tools weapons ; example , high quality flint found northern France , southern England Poland used create flint tools . [ 3 ] Flint mines found chalk areas seams stone followed underground shafts galleries . The mines Grimes Graves Krzemionki especially famous , like flint mines , Neolithic origin ( c. 4000–3000 BC ) . Other hard rocks mined collected axes included greenstone Langdale axe industry based English Lake District . Diorama traditional mining Philippine National Museum . The oldest-known mine archaeological record Ngwenya Mine Eswatini ( Swaziland ) , radiocarbon dating shows 43,000 years old . At site Paleolithic humans mined hematite make red pigment ochre . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Mines similar age Hungary believed sites Neanderthals may mined flint weapons tools . [ 6 ] Ancient Egypt [ edit ] Ancient Egyptians mined malachite Maadi . [ 7 ] At first , Egyptians used bright green malachite stones ornamentations pottery . Later , 2613 2494 BC , large building projects required expeditions abroad area Wadi Maghareh order secure minerals resources available Egypt . [ 8 ] Quarries turquoise copper also found Wadi Hammamat , Tura , Aswan various Nubian sites Sinai Peninsula Timna . [ 8 ] Mining Egypt occurred earliest dynasties . The gold mines Nubia among largest extensive Ancient Egypt . These mines described Greek author Diodorus Siculus , mentions fire-setting one method used break hard rock holding gold . One complexes shown one earliest known maps . The miners crushed ore ground fine powder washing powder gold dust . Ancient Greece Rome [ edit ] Further information : Mining Roman Britain Ancient Roman development Dolaucothi Gold Mines , Wales Mining Europe long history . Examples include silver mines Laurium , helped support Greek city state Athens . Although 20,000 slaves working , technology essentially identical Bronze Age predecessors . [ 9 ] At mines , island Thassos , marble quarried Parians arrived 7th century BC . [ 10 ] The marble shipped away later found archaeologists used buildings including tomb Amphipolis . Philip II Macedon , father Alexander Great , captured gold mines Mount Pangeo 357 BC fund military campaigns . [ 11 ] He also captured gold mines Thrace minting coinage , eventually producing 26 tons per year . However , Romans developed large scale mining methods , especially use large volumes water brought minehead numerous aqueducts . The water used variety purposes , including removing overburden rock debris , called hydraulic mining , well washing comminuted , crushed , ores driving simple machinery . The Romans used hydraulic mining methods large scale prospect veins ore , especially now-obsolete form mining known hushing . They built numerous aqueducts supply water minehead . There , water stored large reservoirs tanks . When full tank opened , flood water sluiced away overburden expose bedrock underneath gold veins . The rock worked upon fire-setting heat rock , would quenched stream water . The resulting thermal shock cracked rock , enabling removed streams water overhead tanks . The Roman miners used similar methods work cassiterite deposits Cornwall lead ore Pennines . The methods developed Romans Spain 25 AD exploit large alluvial gold deposits , largest site Las Medulas , seven long aqueducts tapped local rivers sluiced deposits . The Romans also exploited silver present argentiferous galena mines Cartagena ( Cartago Nova ) , Linares ( Castulo ) , Plasenzuela Azuaga , among many others . [ 12 ] Spain one important mining regions , regions Roman Empire exploited . In Great Britain natives mined minerals millennia , [ 13 ] Roman conquest , scale operations increased dramatically , Romans needed Britannia 's resources , especially gold , silver , tin , lead . Roman techniques limited surface mining . They followed ore veins underground opencast mining longer feasible . At Dolaucothi stoped veins drove adits bare rock drain stopes . The adits also used ventilate workings , especially important fire-setting used . At parts site , penetrated water table dewatered mines using several kinds machines , especially reverse overshot water-wheels . These used extensively copper mines Rio Tinto Spain , one sequence comprised 16 wheels arranged pairs , lifting water 24 metres ( 79 ft ) . They worked treadmills miners standing top slats . Many examples devices found old Roman mines examples preserved British Museum National Museum Wales . [ 14 ] Medieval Europe [ edit ] Main article : Mining metallurgy medieval Europe Agricola , author De Re Metallica Gallery , 12th 13th century , Germany Mining industry underwent dramatic changes medieval Europe . The mining industry early Middle Ages mainly focused extraction copper iron . Other precious metals also used , mainly gilding coinage . Initially , many metals obtained open-pit mining , ore primarily extracted shallow depths , rather deep mine shafts . Around 14th century , growing use weapons , armour , stirrups , horseshoes greatly increased demand iron . Medieval knights , example , often laden 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) plate chain link armour addition swords , lances weapons . [ 15 ] The overwhelming dependency iron military purposes spurred iron production extraction processes . The silver crisis 1465 occurred mines reached depths shafts could longer pumped dry available technology . [ 16 ] Although increased use banknotes , credit copper coins period decrease value , dependence , precious metals , gold silver still remained vital story medieval mining . Due differences social structure society , increasing extraction mineral deposits spread central Europe England mid-sixteenth century . On continent , mineral deposits belonged crown , regalian right stoutly maintained . But England , royal mining rights restricted gold silver ( England virtually deposits ) judicial decision 1568 law 1688 . England iron , zinc , copper , lead , tin ores . Landlords owned base metals coal estates strong inducement extract metals lease deposits collect royalties mine operators . English , German , Dutch capital combined finance extraction refining . Hundreds German technicians skilled workers brought ; 1642 colony 4,000 foreigners mining smelting copper Keswick northwestern mountains . [ 17 ] Use water power form water mills extensive . The water mills employed crushing ore , raising ore shafts , ventilating galleries powering giant bellows . Black powder first used mining Selmecbánya , Kingdom Hungary ( Banská Štiavnica , Slovakia ) 1627 . [ 18 ] Black powder allowed blasting rock earth loosen reveal ore veins . Blasting much faster fire-setting allowed mining previously impenetrable metals ores . [ 19 ] In 1762 , world 's first mining academy established town . The widespread adoption agricultural innovations iron plowshare , well growing use metal building material , also driving force tremendous growth iron industry period . Inventions like arrastra often used Spanish pulverize ore mined . This device powered animals used principles used grain threshing . [ 20 ] Much knowledge medieval mining techniques comes books Biringuccio ’ De la pirotechnia probably importantly Georg Agricola 's De metallica ( 1556 ) . These books detail many different mining methods used German Saxon mines . A prime issue medieval mines , Agricola explains detail , removal water mining shafts . As miners dug deeper access new veins , flooding became real obstacle . The mining industry became dramatically efficient prosperous invention mechanical animal driven pumps . The image Maharlika class Philippine Society , depicted Boxer Codex Gold used form Jewelry ( ca.1400 ) . Classical Philippines [ edit ] See also : Cultural achievements pre-colonial Philippines Mining Philippines began around 1000 BC . The early Filipinos worked various mines gold , silver , copper iron . Jewels , gold ingots , chains , calombigas earrings handed antiquity inherited ancestors . Gold dagger handles , gold dishes , tooth plating , huge gold ornaments also used . [ 21 ] In Laszlo Legeza 's `` Tantric elements pre-Hispanic Philippines Gold Art '' , mentioned gold jewelry Philippine origin found Ancient Egypt . [ 21 ] According Antonio Pigafetta , people Mindoro possessed great skill mixing gold metals gave natural perfect appearance could deceive even best silversmiths . [ 21 ] The natives also known pieces jewelry made precious stones carnelian , agate pearl . Some outstanding examples Philippine jewelry included necklaces , belts , armlets rings placed around waist . Americas [ edit ] Lead mining upper Mississippi River region U.S. , 1865 . During prehistoric times , large amounts copper mined along Lake Superior 's Keweenaw Peninsula nearby Isle Royale ; metallic copper still present near surface colonial times . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Indigenous peoples used Lake Superior copper least 5,000 years ago ; [ 22 ] copper tools , arrowheads , artifacts part extensive native trade network discovered . In addition , obsidian , flint , minerals mined , worked , traded . [ 23 ] Early French explorers encountered sites [ clarification needed ] made use metals due difficulties transporting , [ 23 ] copper eventually traded throughout continent along major river routes . Miners Tamarack Mine Copper Country , Michigan , U.S. 1905 . In early colonial history Americas , `` native gold silver quickly expropriated sent back Spain fleets gold- silver-laden galleons , '' [ 25 ] gold silver originating mostly mines Central South America . Turquoise dated 700 AD mined pre-Columbian America ; Cerillos Mining District New Mexico , estimates `` 15,000 tons rock removed Mt . Chalchihuitl using stone tools 1700 . `` [ 26 ] [ 27 ] In 1727 , Louis Denys ( Denis ) ( 1675–1741 ) , sieur de La Ronde – brother Simon-Pierre Denys de Bonaventure son-in-law René Chartier – took command Fort La Pointe Chequamegon Bay ; natives informed island copper . La Ronde obtained permission French crown operate mines 1733 , becoming `` first practical miner Lake Superior '' ; seven years later , mining halted outbreak Sioux Chippewa tribes . [ 28 ] Mining United States became prevalent 19th century , General Mining Act 1872 passed encourage mining federal lands . [ 29 ] As California Gold Rush mid-19th century , mining minerals precious metals , along ranching , driving factor Westward Expansion Pacific coast . With exploration West , mining camps established `` expressed distinctive spirit , enduring legacy new nation ; '' Gold Rushers would experience problems Land Rushers transient West preceded . [ 30 ] Aided railroads , many traveled West work opportunities mining . Western cities Denver Sacramento originated mining towns . When new areas explored , usually gold ( placer lode ) silver taken possession extracted first . Other metals would often wait railroads canals , coarse gold dust nuggets require smelting easy identify transport . [ 24 ] Modernity [ edit ] View showing miners ' clothes suspended pulleys , also wash basins ventilation system , Kirkland Lake , Ontario , 1936 . In early 20th century , gold silver rush western United States also stimulated mining coal well base metals copper , lead , iron . Areas modern Montana , Utah , Arizona , later Alaska became predominate suppliers copper world , increasingly demanding copper electrical households goods . [ 31 ] Canada 's mining industry grew slowly United States ' due limitations transportation , capital , U.S. competition ; Ontario major producer early 20th century nickel , copper , gold . [ 31 ] Meanwhile , Australia experienced Australian gold rushes 1850s producing 40 % world 's gold , followed establishment large mines Mount Morgan Mine , ran nearly hundred years , Broken Hill ore deposit ( one largest zinc-lead ore deposits ) , iron ore mines Iron Knob . After declines production , another boom mining occurred 1960s . Now , early 21st century , Australia remains major world mineral producer . [ 32 ] As 21st century begins , globalized mining industry large multinational corporations arisen . Peak minerals environmental impacts also become concern . Different elements , particularly rare earth minerals , begun increase demand result new technologies . Mine development life cycle [ edit ] This section cite sources .

( July 2018 ) ( Learn remove template message ) Schematic cut fill mining operation hard rock . The process mining discovery ore body extraction minerals finally returning land natural state consists several distinct steps . The first discovery ore body , carried prospecting exploration find define extent , location value ore body . This leads mathematical resource estimation estimate size grade deposit . This estimation used conduct pre-feasibility study determine theoretical economics ore deposit . This identifies , early , whether investment estimation engineering studies warranted identifies key risks areas work . The next step conduct feasibility study evaluate financial viability , technical financial risks , robustness project . This mining company makes decision whether develop mine walk away project . This includes mine planning evaluate economically recoverable portion deposit , metallurgy ore recoverability , marketability payability ore concentrates , engineering concerns , milling infrastructure costs , finance equity requirements , analysis proposed mine initial excavation way reclamation . The proportion deposit economically recoverable dependent enrichment factor ore area . To gain access mineral deposit within area often necessary mine remove waste material immediate interest miner . The total movement ore waste constitutes mining process . Often waste ore mined life mine , depending nature location ore body . Waste removal placement major cost mining operator , detailed characterization waste material forms essential part geological exploration program mining operation . Once analysis determines given ore body worth recovering , development begins create access ore body . The mine buildings processing plants built , necessary equipment obtained . The operation mine recover ore begins continues long company operating mine finds economical . Once ore mine produce profitably recovered , reclamation begins make land used mine suitable future use . Techniques [ edit ] Underground longwall mining . Mining techniques divided two common excavation types : surface mining sub-surface ( underground ) mining . Today , surface mining much common , produces , example , 85 % minerals ( excluding petroleum natural gas ) United States , including 98 % metallic ores . [ 33 ] Targets divided two general categories materials : placer deposits , consisting valuable minerals contained within river gravels , beach sands , unconsolidated materials ; lode deposits , valuable minerals found veins , layers , mineral grains generally distributed throughout mass actual rock . Both types ore deposit , placer lode , mined surface underground methods . Some mining , including much rare earth elements uranium mining , done less-common methods , in-situ leaching : technique involves digging neither surface underground . The extraction target minerals technique requires soluble , e.g. , potash , potassium chloride , sodium chloride , sodium sulfate , dissolve water . Some minerals , copper minerals uranium oxide , require acid carbonate solutions dissolve . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Surface [ edit ] Main article : Surface mining Surface mining done removing ( stripping ) surface vegetation , dirt , , necessary , layers bedrock order reach buried ore deposits . Techniques surface mining include : open-pit mining , recovery materials open pit ground , quarrying , identical open-pit mining except refers sand , stone clay ; [ 36 ] strip mining , consists stripping surface layers reveal ore/seams underneath ; mountaintop removal , commonly associated coal mining , involves taking top mountain reach ore deposits depth . Most ( ) placer deposits , shallowly buried nature , mined surface methods . Finally , landfill mining involves sites landfills excavated processed . [ 37 ] Landfill mining thought solution dealing long-term methane emissions local pollution . [ 38 ] Garzweiler surface mine , Germany High wall [ edit ] High wall mining another form surface mining evolved auger mining . In high wall mining , coal seam penetrated continuous miner propelled hydraulic Push-beam Transfer Mechanism ( PTM ) . A typical cycle includes sumping ( launch-pushing forward ) shearing ( raising lowering cutter-head boom cut entire height coal seam ) . As coal recovery cycle continues , cutter-head progressively launched coal seam 19.72 feet ( 6.01 ) . Then , Push-beam Transfer Mechanism ( PTM ) automatically inserts 19.72-foot ( 6.01 ) long rectangular Push-beam ( Screw-Conveyor Segment ) center section machine Powerhead cutter-head . The Push-beam system penetrate nearly 1,000 feet ( 300 ) coal seam . One patented high wall mining system uses augers enclosed inside Push-beam prevent mined coal contaminated rock debris conveyance process . Using video imaging and/or gamma ray sensor and/or Geo-Radar systems like coal-rock interface detection sensor ( CID ) , operator see ahead projection seam-rock interface guide continuous miner 's progress . High wall mining produce thousands tons coal contour-strip operations narrow benches , previously mined areas , trench mine applications steep-dip seams controlled water-inflow pump system and/or gas ( inert ) venting system . Underground [ edit ] Main articles : Underground mining ( hard rock ) Underground mining ( soft rock ) Mantrip used transporting miners within underground mine Sub-surface mining consists digging tunnels shafts earth reach buried ore deposits . Ore , processing , waste rock , disposal , brought surface tunnels shafts . Sub-surface mining classified type access shafts used , extraction method technique used reach mineral deposit . Drift mining utilizes horizontal access tunnels , slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts , shaft mining utilizes vertical access shafts . Mining hard soft rock formations require different techniques . Other methods include shrinkage stope mining , mining upward , creating sloping underground room , long wall mining , grinding long ore surface underground , room pillar mining , removing ore rooms leaving pillars place support roof room . Room pillar mining often leads retreat mining , supporting pillars removed miners retreat , allowing room cave , thereby loosening ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining , mining hard rock ( igneous , metamorphic sedimentary ) materials , bore hole mining , drift fill mining , long hole slope mining , sub level caving , block caving .

Huge trucks , shovels cranes employed surface mining move large quantities overburden ore . Processing plants utilize large crushers , mills , reactors , roasters equipment consolidate mineral-rich material extract desired compounds metals ore . Processing [ edit ] Main articles : Mineral processing Extractive metallurgy Once mineral extracted , often processed . The science extractive metallurgy specialized area science metallurgy studies extraction valuable metals ores , especially chemical mechanical means . Mineral processing ( mineral dressing ) specialized area science metallurgy studies mechanical means crushing , grinding , washing enable separation ( extractive metallurgy ) valuable metals minerals gangue ( waste material ) . Processing placer ore material consists gravity-dependent methods separation , sluice boxes . Only minor shaking washing may necessary disaggregate ( unclump ) sands gravels processing . Processing ore lode mine , whether surface subsurface mine , requires rock ore crushed pulverized extraction valuable minerals begins . After lode ore crushed , recovery valuable minerals done one , combination several , mechanical chemical techniques . Since metals present ores oxides sulfides , metal needs reduced metallic form . This accomplished chemical means smelting electrolytic reduction , case aluminium . Geometallurgy combines geologic sciences extractive metallurgy mining . In 2018 , led Chemistry Biochemistry professor Bradley D. Smith , University Notre Dame researchers `` invented new class molecules whose shape size enable capture contain precious metal ions , '' reported study published Journal American Chemical Society . The new method `` converts gold-containing ore chloroauric acid extracts using industrial solvent . The container molecules able selectively separate gold solvent without use water stripping . '' The newly developed molecules eliminate water stripping , whereas mining traditionally `` relies 125-year-old method treats gold-containing ore large quantities poisonous sodium cyanide ... new process milder environmental impact , besides gold , used capturing metals platinum palladium , '' could also used urban mining processes remove precious metals wastewater streams . [ 39 ] Environmental effects [ edit ] Main article : Environmental impact mining Iron hydroxide precipitate stains stream receiving acid drainage surface coal mining . Environmental issues include erosion , formation sinkholes , loss biodiversity , contamination soil , groundwater surface water chemicals mining processes . In cases , additional forest logging done vicinity mines create space storage created debris soil . [ 40 ] Contamination resulting leakage chemicals also affect health local population properly controlled . [ 41 ] Extreme examples pollution mining activities include coal fires , last years even decades , producing massive amounts environmental damage . Mining companies countries required follow stringent environmental rehabilitation codes order minimize environmental impact avoid impacting human health . These codes regulations require common steps environmental impact assessment , development environmental management plans , mine closure planning ( must done start mining operations ) , environmental monitoring operation closure . However , areas , particularly developing world , government regulations may well enforced . For major mining companies company seeking international financing , number mechanisms enforce environmental standards . These generally relate financing standards Equator Principles , IFC environmental standards , criteria Socially responsible investing . Mining companies used oversight financial sector argue level industry self-regulation . [ 42 ] In 1992 , Draft Code Conduct Transnational Corporations proposed Rio Earth Summit UN Centre Transnational Corporations ( UNCTC ) , Business Council Sustainable Development ( BCSD ) together International Chamber Commerce ( ICC ) argued successfully self-regulation instead . [ 43 ] This followed Global Mining Initiative begun nine largest metals mining companies led formation International Council Mining Metals , whose purpose `` act catalyst '' effort improve social environmental performance mining metals industry internationally . [ 42 ] The mining industry provided funding various conservation groups , working conservation agendas odds emerging acceptance rights indigenous people – particularly right make land-use decisions . [ 44 ] Certification mines good practices occurs International Organization Standardization ( ISO ) . For example , ISO 9000 ISO 14001 , certify `` auditable environmental management system '' , involve short inspections , although accused lacking rigor . [ clarification needed ] [ 42 ] :183–84 Certification also available Ceres ' Global Reporting Initiative , reports voluntary unverified . Miscellaneous certification programs exist various projects , typically nonprofit groups . [ 42 ] :185–86 The purpose 2012 EPS PEAKS paper [ 45 ] provide evidence policies managing ecological costs maximise socio-economic benefits mining using host country regulatory initiatives . It found existing literature suggesting donors encourage developing countries : Make environment-poverty link introduce cutting-edge wealth measures natural capital accounts . Reform old taxes line recent financial innovation , engage directly companies , enacting land use impact assessments , incorporate specialised support standards agencies . Set play transparency community participation initiatives using wealth accrued . Waste [ edit ] Ore mills generate large amounts waste , called tailings . For example , 99 tons waste generated per ton copper , even higher ratios gold mining – 5.3 g gold extracted per ton ore , ton gold produces 200,000 tons tailings . [ 46 ] ( As time goes richer deposits exhausted – technology improves permit – number going .5 g less . ) These tailings toxic . Tailings , usually produced slurry , commonly dumped ponds made naturally existing valleys . [ 47 ] These ponds secured impoundments ( dams embankment dams ) . [ 47 ] In 2000 estimated 3,500 tailings impoundments existed , every year , 2 5 major failures 35 minor failures occurred ; [ 48 ] example , Marcopper mining disaster least 2 million tons tailings released local river . [ 48 ] In 2015 , Barrick Gold spilled 1 million liters cyanide total five rivers Argentina near Veladero mine . [ 49 ] In central Finland , Talvivaara Terrafame polymetal mine waste effluent since 2008 numerous leaks saline mine water resulted ecological collapse nearby lake . [ 50 ] Subaqueous tailings disposal another option . [ 47 ] The mining industry argued submarine tailings disposal ( STD ) , disposes tailings sea , ideal avoids risks tailings ponds ; although practice illegal United States Canada , used developing world . [ 51 ] The waste classified either sterile mineralised , acid generating potential , movement storage material forms major part mine planning process . When mineralised package determined economic cut-off , near-grade mineralised waste usually dumped separately view later treatment market conditions change becomes economically viable . Civil engineering design parameters used design waste dumps , special conditions apply high-rainfall areas seismically active areas . Waste dump designs must meet regulatory requirements country whose jurisdiction mine located . It also common practice rehabilitate dumps internationally acceptable standard , cases means higher standards local regulatory standard applied . [ 48 ] Renewable energy [ edit ] Many mining sites remote connected grid . Electricity typically generated diesel generators . Due high transportation cost theft transportation cost generating electricity normally high . Renewable energy applications becoming alternative amendment . Both solar wind power plants contribute saving diesel costs mining sites . Renewable energy applications built mining sites . [ 52 ] Cost savings reach 70 % . [ 53 ] Industry [ edit ] Main articles : List mines , List mining companies , Category : Mining companies , Category : Mining industry country Mining exists many countries . London known capital global `` mining houses '' Rio Tinto Group , BHP Billiton , Anglo American PLC . [ 54 ] The US mining industry also large , dominated coal nonmetal minerals ( e.g. , rock sand ) , various regulations worked reduce significance mining United States . [ 54 ] In 2007 total market capitalization mining companies reported US $ 962 billion , compares total global market cap publicly traded companies US $ 50 trillion 2007 . [ 55 ] In 2002 , Chile Peru reportedly major mining countries South America . [ 56 ] The mineral industry Africa includes mining various minerals ; produces relatively little industrial metals copper , lead , zinc , according one estimate percent world reserves 40 % gold , 60 % cobalt , 90 % world 's platinum group metals . [ 57 ] Mining India significant part country 's economy . In developed world , mining Australia , BHP Billiton founded headquartered country , mining Canada particularly significant . For rare earth minerals mining , China reportedly controlled 95 % production 2013 . [ 58 ] The Bingham Canyon Mine Rio Tinto 's subsidiary , Kennecott Utah Copper . While exploration mining conducted individual entrepreneurs small businesses , modern-day mines large enterprises requiring large amounts capital establish . Consequently , mining sector industry dominated large , often multinational , companies , publicly listed . It argued referred 'mining industry ' actually two sectors , one specializing exploration new resources mining resources . The exploration sector typically made individuals small mineral resource companies , called `` juniors '' , dependent venture capital . The mining sector made large multinational companies sustained production mining operations . Various industries equipment manufacture , environmental testing , metallurgy analysis rely , support , mining industry throughout world . Canadian stock exchanges particular focus mining companies , particularly junior exploration companies Toronto 's TSX Venture Exchange ; Canadian companies raise capital exchanges invest money exploration globally . [ 54 ] Some argued juniors exists substantial sector illegitimate companies primarily focused manipulating stock prices . [ 54 ] Mining operations grouped five major categories terms respective resources . These oil gas extraction , coal mining , metal ore mining , nonmetallic mineral mining quarrying , mining support activities . [ 59 ] Of categories , oil gas extraction remains one largest terms global economic importance . Prospecting potential mining sites , vital area concern mining industry , done using sophisticated new technologies seismic prospecting remote-sensing satellites . Mining heavily affected prices commodity minerals , often volatile . The 2000s commodities boom ( `` commodities supercycle '' ) increased prices commodities , driving aggressive mining . In addition , price gold increased dramatically 2000s , increased gold mining ; example , one study found conversion forest Amazon increased six-fold period 2003–2006 ( 292 ha/yr ) period 2006–2009 ( 1,915 ha/yr ) , largely due artisanal mining . [ 60 ] Corporate classifications [ edit ] Mining companies classified based size financial capabilities : Major companies considered adjusted annual mining-related revenue US $ 500 million , financial capability develop major mine . Intermediate companies least $ 50 million annual revenue less $ 500 million . Junior companies rely equity financing principal means funding exploration . Juniors mainly pure exploration companies , may also produce minimally , revenue exceeding US $ 50 million . [ 61 ] Regulation governance [ edit ] New regulations process legislative reforms aim improve harmonization stability mining sector mineral-rich countries . [ 62 ] New legislation mining industry African countries still appears issue , potential solved , consensus reached best approach . [ 63 ] By beginning 21st century booming increasingly complex mining sector mineral-rich countries providing slight benefits local communities , especially given sustainability issues . Increasing debate influence NGOs local communities called new approaches would also include disadvantaged communities , work towards sustainable development even mine closure ( including transparency revenue management ) . By early 2000s , community development issues resettlements became mainstream concerns World Bank mining projects . [ 63 ] Mining-industry expansion mineral prices increased 2003 also potential fiscal revenues countries created omission economic sectors terms finances development . Furthermore , highlighted regional local demand mining revenues inability sub-national governments effectively use revenues . The Fraser Institute ( Canadian think tank ) highlighted [ clarification needed ] environmental protection laws developing countries , well voluntary efforts mining companies improve environmental impact . [ 64 ] In 2007 Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) mainstreamed [ clarification needed ] countries cooperating World Bank mining industry reform . [ 63 ] The EITI operates implemented support EITI multi-donor trust fund , managed World Bank . [ 65 ] The EITI aims increase transparency transactions governments companies extractive industries [ 66 ] monitoring revenues benefits industries recipient governments . The entrance process voluntary country monitored multiple stakeholders including governments , private companies civil society representatives , responsible disclosure dissemination reconciliation report ; [ 63 ] however , competitive disadvantage company-by company public report businesses Ghana least , main constraint . [ 67 ] Therefore , outcome assessment terms failure success new EITI regulation `` rest government 's shoulders '' also civil society companies . [ 68 ] On hand , implementation issues ; inclusion exclusion artisanal mining small-scale mining ( ASM ) EITI deal `` non-cash '' payments made companies subnational governments . Furthermore , disproportionate revenues mining industry bring comparatively small number people employs , [ 69 ] causes problems , like lack investment less lucrative sectors , leading swings government revenuebecause volatility oil markets . Artisanal mining clearly issue EITI Countries Central African Republic , D.R . Congo , Guinea , Liberia Sierra Leone – i.e . almost half mining countries implementing EITI . [ 69 ] Among things , limited scope EITI involving disparity terms knowledge industry negotiation skills , thus far flexibility policy ( e.g . liberty countries expand beyond minimum requirements adapt needs ) , creates another risk unsuccessful implementation . Public awareness increase , government act bridge public initiative successful outcome policy important element considered . [ 70 ] World Bank [ edit ] The World Bank involved mining since 1955 , mainly grants International Bank Reconstruction Development , Bank 's Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency offering political risk insurance . [ 71 ] Between 1955 1990 provided $ 2 billion fifty mining projects , broadly categorized reform rehabilitation , greenfield mine construction , mineral processing , technical assistance , engineering . These projects criticized , particularly Ferro Carajas project Brazil , begun 1981 . [ 72 ] The World Bank established mining codes intended increase foreign investment ; 1988 solicited feedback 45 mining companies increase involvement . [ 42 ] :20 In 1992 World Bank began push privatization government-owned mining companies new set codes , beginning report The Strategy African Mining . In 1997 , Latin America 's largest miner Companhia Vale Rio Doce ( CVRD ) privatized . These developments Philippines 1995 Mining Act led bank publish third report ( Assistance Minerals Sector Development Reform Member Countries ) endorsed mandatory environment impact assessments attention concerns local population . The codes based report influential legislation developing nations . The new codes intended encourage development tax holidays , zero custom duties , reduced income taxes , related measures . [ 42 ] :22 The results codes analyzed group University Quebec , concluded codes promote foreign investment `` fall short permitting sustainable development '' . [ 73 ] The observed negative correlation natural resources economic development known resource curse . Safety [ edit ] Mining transport Devnya , Bulgaria . Main article : Mine safetySafety long concern mining business , especially sub-surface mining . The Courrières mine disaster , Europe 's worst mining accident , involved death 1,099 miners Northern France March 10 , 1906 . This disaster surpassed Benxihu Colliery accident China April 26 , 1942 , killed 1,549 miners . [ 74 ] While mining today substantially safer previous decades , mining accidents still occur . Government figures indicate 5,000 Chinese miners die accidents year , reports suggested figure high 20,000 . [ 75 ] Mining accidents continue worldwide , including accidents causing dozens fatalities time 2007 Ulyanovskaya Mine disaster Russia , 2009 Heilongjiang mine explosion China , 2010 Upper Big Branch Mine disaster United States . Mining identified National Institute Occupational Safety Health ( NIOSH ) priority industry sector National Occupational Research Agenda ( NORA ) identify provide intervention strategies regarding occupational health safety issues . [ 76 ] The Mining Safety Health Administration ( MSHA ) established 1978 `` work prevent death , illness , injury mining promote safe healthful workplaces US miners . `` [ 77 ] Since implementation 1978 , number miner fatalities decreased 242 miners 1978 24 miners 2019 . There numerous occupational hazards associated mining , including exposure rockdust lead diseases silicosis , asbestosis , pneumoconiosis . Gases mine lead asphyxiation could also ignited . Mining equipment generate considerable noise , putting workers risk hearing loss . Cave-ins , rock falls , exposure excess heat also known hazards . The current NIOSH Recommended Exposure Limit ( REL ) noise 85 dBA 3 dBA exchange rate MSHA Permissible Exposure Limit ( PEL ) 90 dBA 5 dBA exchange rate 8-hour time-weighted average . NIOSH found 25 % noise-exposed workers Mining , Quarrying , Oil Gas Extraction hearing impairment . [ 78 ] The prevalence hearing loss increased 1 % 1991-2001 within workers . Noise studies conducted several mining environments . Stageloaders ( 84-102 dBA ) , shearers ( 85-99 dBA ) , auxiliary fans ( 84–120 dBA ) , continuous mining machines ( 78–109 dBA ) , roof bolters ( 92–103 dBA ) represent noisiest equipment underground coal mines . [ 79 ] Dragline oilers , dozer operators , welders using air arcing occupations highest noise exposures among surface coal miners . [ 80 ] Coal mines highest hearing loss injury likelihood . [ 81 ] Proper ventilation , hearing protection , spraying equipment water important safety practices mines .

Metal reserves recycling [ edit ] Main articles : Landfill mining Recycling See also : Conflict resource List critical mineral raw materials During 20th century , variety metals used society grew rapidly . Today , development major nations China India advances technologies fueling ever-greater demand . The result metal mining activities expanding world 's metal stocks ground use rather ground unused reserves . An example in-use stock copper . Between 1932 1999 , copper use US rose 73 kilograms ( 161 lb ) 238 kilograms ( 525 lb ) per person . [ 89 ] 95 % energy used make aluminium bauxite ore saved using recycled material . [ 90 ] However , levels metals recycling generally low . In 2010 , International Resource Panel , hosted United Nations Environment Programme ( UNEP ) , published reports metal stocks exist within society [ 91 ] recycling rates . [ 89 ] The report 's authors observed metal stocks society serve huge mines ground . However , warned recycling rates rare metals used applications mobile phones , battery packs hybrid cars , fuel cells low unless future end-of-life recycling rates dramatically stepped critical metals become unavailable use modern technology . As recycling rates low much metal already extracted , landfills contain higher concentrations metal mines . [ 92 ] This especially true aluminium , used cans , precious metals , found discarded electronics . [ 93 ] Furthermore , waste 15 years still broken , less processing would required compared mining ores . A study undertaken Cranfield University found £360 million metals could mined 4 landfill sites . [ 94 ] There also 20MJ/kg energy waste , potentially making re-extraction profitable . [ 95 ] However , although first landfill mine opened Tel Aviv , Israel 1953 , little work followed due abundance accessible ores .
