It involves computers learning data provided carry certain tasks . For simple tasks assigned computers , possible program algorithms telling machine execute steps required solve problem hand ; computer 's part , learning needed . For advanced tasks , challenging human manually create needed algorithms . In practice , turn effective help machine develop algorithm , rather human programmers specify every needed step . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The discipline machine learning employs various approaches teach computers accomplish tasks fully satisfactory algorithm available . In cases vast numbers potential answers exist , one approach label correct answers valid . This used training data computer improve algorithm ( ) uses determine correct answers . For example , train system task digital character recognition , MNIST dataset handwritten digits often used . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Machine learning approaches [ edit ] Machine learning approaches traditionally divided three broad categories , depending nature `` signal '' `` feedback '' available learning system : Supervised learning : The computer presented example inputs desired outputs , given `` teacher '' , goal learn general rule maps inputs outputs . Unsupervised learning : No labels given learning algorithm , leaving find structure input . Unsupervised learning goal ( discovering hidden patterns data ) means towards end ( feature learning ) . Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts dynamic environment must perform certain goal ( driving vehicle playing game opponent ) . As navigates problem space , program provided feedback 's analogous rewards , tries maximize . [ 4 ] Other approaches developed n't fit neatly three-fold categorisation , sometimes one used machine learning system . For example topic modeling , dimensionality reduction meta learning . [ 9 ] As 2020 , deep learning become dominant approach much ongoing work field machine learning . [ 7 ] History relationships fields [ edit ] See also : Timeline machine learning The term machine learning coined 1959 Arthur Samuel , American IBMer pioneer field computer gaming artificial intelligence . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] A representative book machine learning research 1960s Nilsson 's book Learning Machines , dealing mostly machine learning pattern classification . [ 12 ] Interest related pattern recognition continued 1970s , described Duda Hart 1973 . [ 13 ] In 1981 report given using teaching strategies neural network learns recognize 40 characters ( 26 letters , 10 digits , 4 special symbols ) computer terminal . [ 14 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided widely quoted , formal definition algorithms studied machine learning field : `` A computer program said learn experience E respect class tasks T performance measure P performance tasks T , measured P , improves experience E. '' [ 15 ] This definition tasks machine learning concerned offers fundamentally operational definition rather defining field cognitive terms . This follows Alan Turing 's proposal paper `` Computing Machinery Intelligence '' , question `` Can machines think ? '' replaced question `` Can machines ( thinking entities ) ? '' . [ 16 ] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] As scientific endeavor , machine learning grew quest artificial intelligence . In early days AI academic discipline , researchers interested machines learn data . They attempted approach problem various symbolic methods , well termed `` neural networks '' ; mostly perceptrons models later found reinventions generalized linear models statistics . [ 17 ] Probabilistic reasoning also employed , especially automated medical diagnosis . [ 18 ] :488 However , increasing emphasis logical , knowledge-based approach caused rift AI machine learning . Probabilistic systems plagued theoretical practical problems data acquisition representation . [ 18 ] :488 By 1980 , expert systems come dominate AI , statistics favor . [ 19 ] Work symbolic/knowledge-based learning continue within AI , leading inductive logic programming , statistical line research outside field AI proper , pattern recognition information retrieval . [ 18 ] :708–710 ; 755 Neural networks research abandoned AI computer science around time . This line , , continued outside AI/CS field , `` connectionism '' , researchers disciplines including Hopfield , Rumelhart Hinton . Their main success came mid-1980s reinvention backpropagation . [ 18 ] :25 Machine learning , reorganized separate field , started flourish 1990s . The field changed goal achieving artificial intelligence tackling solvable problems practical nature . It shifted focus away symbolic approaches inherited AI , toward methods models borrowed statistics probability theory . [ 19 ] As 2019 , many sources continue assert machine learning remains subfield AI . Yet practitioners , example Dr Daniel Hulme , teaches AI runs company operating field , argues machine learning AI separate . [ 8 ] [ 20 ] [ 7 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning data mining often employ methods overlap significantly , machine learning focuses prediction , based known properties learned training data , data mining focuses discovery ( previously ) unknown properties data ( analysis step knowledge discovery databases ) . Data mining uses many machine learning methods , different goals ; hand , machine learning also employs data mining methods `` unsupervised learning '' preprocessing step improve learner accuracy . Much confusion two research communities ( often separate conferences separate journals , ECML PKDD major exception ) comes basic assumptions work : machine learning , performance usually evaluated respect ability reproduce known knowledge , knowledge discovery data mining ( KDD ) key task discovery previously unknown knowledge . Evaluated respect known knowledge , uninformed ( unsupervised ) method easily outperformed supervised methods , typical KDD task , supervised methods used due unavailability training data . Optimization [ edit ] Machine learning also intimate ties optimization : many learning problems formulated minimization loss function training set examples . Loss functions express discrepancy predictions model trained actual problem instances ( example , classification , one wants assign label instances , models trained correctly predict pre-assigned labels set examples ) . The difference two fields arises goal generalization : optimization algorithms minimize loss training set , machine learning concerned minimizing loss unseen samples . [ 21 ] Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning statistics closely related fields terms methods , distinct principal goal : statistics draws population inferences sample , machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns . [ 22 ] According Michael I. Jordan , ideas machine learning , methodological principles theoretical tools , long pre-history statistics . [ 23 ] He also suggested term data science placeholder call overall field . [ 23 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms : data model algorithmic model , [ 24 ] wherein `` algorithmic model '' means less machine learning algorithms like Random forest . Some statisticians adopted methods machine learning , leading combined field call statistical learning . [ 25 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles : Computational learning theory Statistical learning theory A core objective learner generalize experience . [ 4 ] [ 26 ] Generalization context ability learning machine perform accurately new , unseen examples/tasks experienced learning data set . The training examples come generally unknown probability distribution ( considered representative space occurrences ) learner build general model space enables produce sufficiently accurate predictions new cases . The computational analysis machine learning algorithms performance branch theoretical computer science known computational learning theory . Because training sets finite future uncertain , learning theory usually yield guarantees performance algorithms . Instead , probabilistic bounds performance quite common . The bias–variance decomposition one way quantify generalization error . For best performance context generalization , complexity hypothesis match complexity function underlying data . If hypothesis less complex function , model fitted data . If complexity model increased response , training error decreases . But hypothesis complex , model subject overfitting generalization poorer . [ 27 ] In addition performance bounds , learning theorists study time complexity feasibility learning . In computational learning theory , computation considered feasible done polynomial time . There two kinds time complexity results . Positive results show certain class functions learned polynomial time . Negative results show certain classes learned polynomial time . Approaches [ edit ] Types learning algorithms [ edit ] The types machine learning algorithms differ approach , type data input output , type task problem intended solve . Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article : Supervised learning A support vector machine supervised learning model divides data regions separated linear boundary . Here , linear boundary divides black circles white . Supervised learning algorithms build mathematical model set data contains inputs desired outputs . [ 28 ] The data known training data , consists set training examples . Each training example one inputs desired output , also known supervisory signal . In mathematical model , training example represented array vector , sometimes called feature vector , training data represented matrix . Through iterative optimization objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn function used predict output associated new inputs . [ 29 ] An optimal function allow algorithm correctly determine output inputs part training data . An algorithm improves accuracy outputs predictions time said learned perform task . [ 15 ] Types supervised learning algorithms include Active learning , classification regression . [ 30 ] Classification algorithms used outputs restricted limited set values , regression algorithms used outputs may numerical value within range . As example , classification algorithm filters emails , input would incoming email , output would name folder file email . Similarity learning area supervised machine learning closely related regression classification , goal learn examples using similarity function measures similar related two objects . It applications ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking , face verification , speaker verification . Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article : Unsupervised learningSee also : Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms take set data contains inputs , find structure data , like grouping clustering data points . The algorithms , therefore , learn test data labeled , classified categorized . Instead responding feedback , unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities data react based presence absence commonalities new piece data . A central application unsupervised learning field density estimation statistics , finding probability density function . [ 31 ] Though unsupervised learning encompasses domains involving summarizing explaining data features . Cluster analysis assignment set observations subsets ( called clusters ) observations within cluster similar according one predesignated criteria , observations drawn different clusters dissimilar . Different clustering techniques make different assumptions structure data , often defined similarity metric evaluated , example , internal compactness , similarity members cluster , separation , difference clusters . Other methods based estimated density graph connectivity . Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article : Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls unsupervised learning ( without labeled training data ) supervised learning ( completely labeled training data ) . Some training examples missing training labels , yet many machine-learning researchers found unlabeled data , used conjunction small amount labeled data , produce considerable improvement learning accuracy . In weakly supervised learning , training labels noisy , limited , imprecise ; however , labels often cheaper obtain , resulting larger effective training sets . [ 32 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article : Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning area machine learning concerned software agents ought take actions environment maximize notion cumulative reward . Due generality , field studied many disciplines , game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimization , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics genetic algorithms . In machine learning , environment typically represented Markov Decision Process ( MDP ) . Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques . [ 33 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms assume knowledge exact mathematical model MDP , used exact models infeasible . Reinforcement learning algorithms used autonomous vehicles learning play game human opponent . Self learning [ edit ] Self-learning machine learning paradigm introduced 1982 along neural network capable self-learning named Crossbar Adaptive Array ( CAA ) . [ 34 ] It learning external rewards external teacher advices . The CAA self-learning algorithm computes , crossbar fashion , decisions actions emotions ( feelings ) consequence situations . The system driven interaction cognition emotion . [ 35 ] The self-learning algorithm updates memory matrix W =||w ( , ) || iteration executes following machine learning routine : In situation perform action ; Receive consequence situation ’ ; Compute emotion consequence situation v ( ’ ) ; Update crossbar memory w ’ ( , ) = w ( , ) + v ( ’ ) . It system one input , situation , one output , action ( behavior ) . There neither separate reinforcement input advice input environment . The backpropagated value ( secondary reinforcement ) emotion toward consequence situation . The CAA exists two environments , one behavioral environment behaves , genetic environment , wherefrom initially receives initial emotions situations encountered behavioral environment . After receiving genome ( species ) vector genetic environment , CAA learns goal seeking behavior , environment contains desirable undesirable situations . [ 36 ] Feature learning [ edit ] Main article : Feature learning Several learning algorithms aim discovering better representations inputs provided training . [ 37 ] Classic examples include principal components analysis cluster analysis . Feature learning algorithms , also called representation learning algorithms , often attempt preserve information input also transform way makes useful , often pre-processing step performing classification predictions . This technique allows reconstruction inputs coming unknown data-generating distribution , necessarily faithful configurations implausible distribution . This replaces manual feature engineering , allows machine learn features use perform specific task . Feature learning either supervised unsupervised . In supervised feature learning , features learned using labeled input data . Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning , features learned unlabeled input data . Examples include dictionary learning , independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorization [ 38 ] various forms clustering . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt constraint learned representation low-dimensional . Sparse coding algorithms attempt constraint learned representation sparse , meaning mathematical model many zeros . Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim learn low-dimensional representations directly tensor representations multidimensional data , without reshaping higher-dimensional vectors . [ 42 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels representation , hierarchy features , higher-level , abstract features defined terms ( generating ) lower-level features . It argued intelligent machine one learns representation disentangles underlying factors variation explain observed data . [ 43 ] Feature learning motivated fact machine learning tasks classification often require input mathematically computationally convenient process . However , real-world data images , video , sensory data yielded attempts algorithmically define specific features . An alternative discover features representations examination , without relying explicit algorithms . Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article : Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning feature learning method training example represented linear combination basis functions , assumed sparse matrix . The method strongly NP-hard difficult solve approximately . [ 44 ] A popular heuristic method sparse dictionary learning K-SVD algorithm . Sparse dictionary learning applied several contexts . In classification , problem determine class previously unseen training example belongs . For dictionary class already built , new training example associated class best sparsely represented corresponding dictionary . Sparse dictionary learning also applied image de-noising . The key idea clean image patch sparsely represented image dictionary , noise . [ 45 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article : Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection , also known outlier detection , identification rare items , events observations raise suspicions differing significantly majority data . [ 46 ] Typically , anomalous items represent issue bank fraud , structural defect , medical problems errors text . Anomalies referred outliers , novelties , noise , deviations exceptions . [ 47 ] In particular , context abuse network intrusion detection , interesting objects often rare objects , unexpected bursts activity . This pattern adhere common statistical definition outlier rare object , many outlier detection methods ( particular , unsupervised algorithms ) fail data , unless aggregated appropriately . Instead , cluster analysis algorithm may able detect micro-clusters formed patterns . [ 48 ] Three broad categories anomaly detection techniques exist . [ 49 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies unlabeled test data set assumption majority instances data set normal , looking instances seem fit least remainder data set . Supervised anomaly detection techniques require data set labeled `` normal '' `` abnormal '' involves training classifier ( key difference many statistical classification problems inherently unbalanced nature outlier detection ) . Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct model representing normal behavior given normal training data set test likelihood test instance generated model . Robot learning [ edit ] In developmental robotics , robot learning algorithms generate sequences learning experiences , also known curriculum , cumulatively acquire new skills self-guided exploration social interaction humans . These robots use guidance mechanisms active learning , maturation , motor synergies imitation . Association rules [ edit ] Main article : Association rule learningSee also : Inductive logic programming Association rule learning rule-based machine learning method discovering relationships variables large databases . It intended identify strong rules discovered databases using measure `` interestingness '' . [ 50 ] Rule-based machine learning general term machine learning method identifies , learns , evolves `` rules '' store , manipulate apply knowledge . The defining characteristic rule-based machine learning algorithm identification utilization set relational rules collectively represent knowledge captured system . This contrast machine learning algorithms commonly identify singular model universally applied instance order make prediction . [ 51 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning , artificial immune systems . Based concept strong rules , Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński Arun Swami introduced association rules discovering regularities products large-scale transaction data recorded point-of-sale ( POS ) systems supermarkets . [ 52 ] For example , rule { n n , p e } ⇒ { b u r g e r } { \displaystyle \ { \mathrm { onions , potatoes } \ } \Rightarrow \ { \mathrm { burger } \ } } found sales data supermarket would indicate customer buys onions potatoes together , likely also buy hamburger meat . Such information used basis decisions marketing activities promotional pricing product placements . In addition market basket analysis , association rules employed today application areas including Web usage mining , intrusion detection , continuous production , bioinformatics . In contrast sequence mining , association rule learning typically consider order items either within transaction across transactions . Learning classifier systems ( LCS ) family rule-based machine learning algorithms combine discovery component , typically genetic algorithm , learning component , performing either supervised learning , reinforcement learning , unsupervised learning . They seek identify set context-dependent rules collectively store apply knowledge piecewise manner order make predictions . [ 53 ] Inductive logic programming ( ILP ) approach rule-learning using logic programming uniform representation input examples , background knowledge , hypotheses . Given encoding known background knowledge set examples represented logical database facts , ILP system derive hypothesized logic program entails positive negative examples . Inductive programming related field considers kind programming languages representing hypotheses ( logic programming ) , functional programs . Inductive logic programming particularly useful bioinformatics natural language processing . Gordon Plotkin Ehud Shapiro laid initial theoretical foundation inductive machine learning logical setting . [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Shapiro built first implementation ( Model Inference System ) 1981 : Prolog program inductively inferred logic programs positive negative examples . [ 57 ] The term inductive refers philosophical induction , suggesting theory explain observed facts , rather mathematical induction , proving property members well-ordered set . Models [ edit ] Performing machine learning involves creating model , trained training data process additional data make predictions . Various types models used researched machine learning systems . Artificial neural networks [ edit ] Main article : Artificial neural networkSee also : Deep learning An artificial neural network interconnected group nodes , akin vast network neurons brain . Here , circular node represents artificial neuron arrow represents connection output one artificial neuron input another . Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) , connectionist systems , computing systems vaguely inspired biological neural networks constitute animal brains . Such systems `` learn '' perform tasks considering examples , generally without programmed task-specific rules . An ANN model based collection connected units nodes called `` artificial neurons '' , loosely model neurons biological brain . Each connection , like synapses biological brain , transmit information , `` signal '' , one artificial neuron another . An artificial neuron receives signal process signal additional artificial neurons connected . In common ANN implementations , signal connection artificial neurons real number , output artificial neuron computed non-linear function sum inputs . The connections artificial neurons called `` edges '' . Artificial neurons edges typically weight adjusts learning proceeds . The weight increases decreases strength signal connection . Artificial neurons may threshold signal sent aggregate signal crosses threshold . Typically , artificial neurons aggregated layers . Different layers may perform different kinds transformations inputs . Signals travel first layer ( input layer ) last layer ( output layer ) , possibly traversing layers multiple times . The original goal ANN approach solve problems way human brain would . However , time , attention moved performing specific tasks , leading deviations biology . Artificial neural networks used variety tasks , including computer vision , speech recognition , machine translation , social network filtering , playing board video games medical diagnosis . Deep learning consists multiple hidden layers artificial neural network . This approach tries model way human brain processes light sound vision hearing . Some successful applications deep learning computer vision speech recognition . [ 58 ] Decision trees [ edit ] Main article : Decision tree learning Decision tree learning uses decision tree predictive model go observations item ( represented branches ) conclusions item 's target value ( represented leaves ) . It one predictive modeling approaches used statistics , data mining machine learning . Tree models target variable take discrete set values called classification trees ; tree structures , leaves represent class labels branches represent conjunctions features lead class labels . Decision trees target variable take continuous values ( typically real numbers ) called regression trees . In decision analysis , decision tree used visually explicitly represent decisions decision making . In data mining , decision tree describes data , resulting classification tree input decision making . Support vector machines [ edit ] Main article : Support vector machines Support vector machines ( SVMs ) , also known support vector networks , set related supervised learning methods used classification regression . Given set training examples , marked belonging one two categories , SVM training algorithm builds model predicts whether new example falls one category . [ 59 ] An SVM training algorithm non-probabilistic , binary , linear classifier , although methods Platt scaling exist use SVM probabilistic classification setting . In addition performing linear classification , SVMs efficiently perform non-linear classification using called kernel trick , implicitly mapping inputs high-dimensional feature spaces . Illustration linear regression data set . Regression analysis [ edit ] Main article : Regression analysis Regression analysis encompasses large variety statistical methods estimate relationship input variables associated features . Its common form linear regression , single line drawn best fit given data according mathematical criterion ordinary least squares . The latter often extended regularization ( mathematics ) methods mitigate overfitting bias , ridge regression . When dealing non-linear problems , go-to models include polynomial regression ( example , used trendline fitting Microsoft Excel [ 60 ] ) , Logistic regression ( often used statistical classification ) even kernel regression , introduces non-linearity taking advantage kernel trick implicitly map input variables higher dimensional space . Bayesian networks [ edit ] Main article : Bayesian network A simple Bayesian network . Rain influences whether sprinkler activated , rain sprinkler influence whether grass wet . A Bayesian network , belief network directed acyclic graphical model probabilistic graphical model represents set random variables conditional independence directed acyclic graph ( DAG ) . For example , Bayesian network could represent probabilistic relationships diseases symptoms . Given symptoms , network used compute probabilities presence various diseases . Efficient algorithms exist perform inference learning . Bayesian networks model sequences variables , like speech signals protein sequences , called dynamic Bayesian networks . Generalizations Bayesian networks represent solve decision problems uncertainty called influence diagrams . Genetic algorithms [ edit ] Main article : Genetic algorithm A genetic algorithm ( GA ) search algorithm heuristic technique mimics process natural selection , using methods mutation crossover generate new genotypes hope finding good solutions given problem . In machine learning , genetic algorithms used 1980s 1990s . [ 61 ] [ 62 ] Conversely , machine learning techniques used improve performance genetic evolutionary algorithms . [ 63 ] Training models [ edit ] Usually , machine learning models require lot data order perform well . Usually , training machine learning model , one needs collect large , representative sample data training set . Data training set varied corpus text , collection images , data collected individual users service . Overfitting something watch training machine learning model . Federated learning [ edit ] Main article : Federated learning Federated learning adapted form Distributed Artificial Intelligence training machine learning models decentralizes training process , allowing users ' privacy maintained needing send data centralized server . This also increases efficiency decentralizing training process many devices . For example , Gboard uses federated machine learning train search query prediction models users ' mobile phones without send individual searches back Google . [ 64 ] Applications [ edit ] There many applications machine learning , including : Agriculture Anatomy Adaptive websites Affective computing Banking Bioinformatics Brain–machine interfaces Cheminformatics Citizen science Computer networks Computer vision Credit-card fraud detection Data quality DNA sequence classification Economics Financial market analysis [ 65 ] General game playing Handwriting recognition Information retrieval Insurance Internet fraud detection Linguistics Machine learning control Machine perception Machine translation Marketing Medical diagnosis Natural language processing Natural language understanding Online advertising Optimization Recommender systems Robot locomotion Search engines Sentiment analysis Sequence mining Software engineering Speech recognition Structural health monitoring Syntactic pattern recognition Telecommunication Theorem proving Time series forecasting User behavior analytics In 2006 , media-services provider Netflix held first `` Netflix Prize '' competition find program better predict user preferences improve accuracy existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm least 10 % . A joint team made researchers AT & T Labs-Research collaboration teams Big Chaos Pragmatic Theory built ensemble model win Grand Prize 2009 $ 1 million . [ 66 ] Shortly prize awarded , Netflix realized viewers ' ratings best indicators viewing patterns ( `` everything recommendation '' ) changed recommendation engine accordingly . [ 67 ] In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote firm Rebellion Research use machine learning predict financial crisis . [ 68 ] In 2012 , co-founder Sun Microsystems , Vinod Khosla , predicted 80 % medical doctors ' jobs would lost next two decades automated machine learning medical diagnostic software . [ 69 ] In 2014 , reported machine learning algorithm applied field art history study fine art paintings , may revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists . [ 70 ] In 2019 Springer Nature published first research book created using machine learning . [ 71 ] Limitations [ edit ] Although machine learning transformative fields , machine-learning programs often fail deliver expected results . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] [ 74 ] Reasons numerous : lack ( suitable ) data , lack access data , data bias , privacy problems , badly chosen tasks algorithms , wrong tools people , lack resources , evaluation problems . [ 75 ] In 2018 , self-driving car Uber failed detect pedestrian , killed collision . [ 76 ] Attempts use machine learning healthcare IBM Watson system failed deliver even years time billions investment . [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Bias [ edit ] Main article : Algorithmic bias Machine learning approaches particular suffer different data biases . A machine learning system trained current customers may able predict needs new customer groups represented training data . When trained man-made data , machine learning likely pick constitutional unconscious biases already present society . [ 79 ] Language models learned data shown contain human-like biases . [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Machine learning systems used criminal risk assessment found biased black people . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] In 2015 , Google photos would often tag black people gorillas , [ 84 ] 2018 still well resolved , Google reportedly still using workaround remove gorillas training data , thus able recognize real gorillas . [ 85 ] Similar issues recognizing non-white people found many systems . [ 86 ] In 2016 , Microsoft tested chatbot learned Twitter , quickly picked racist sexist language . [ 87 ] Because challenges , effective use machine learning may take longer adopted domains . [ 88 ] Concern fairness machine learning , , reducing bias machine learning propelling use human good increasingly expressed artificial intelligence scientists , including Fei-Fei Li , reminds engineers `` There ’ nothing artificial AI ... It ’ inspired people , ’ created people , and—most importantly—it impacts people . It powerful tool beginning understand , profound responsibility. ” [ 89 ] Model assessments [ edit ] Classification machine learning models validated accuracy estimation techniques like Holdout method , splits data training test set ( conventionally 2/3 training set 1/3 test set designation ) evaluates performance training model test set . In comparison , K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions data K subsets K experiments performed respectively considering 1 subset evaluation remaining K-1 subsets training model . In addition holdout cross-validation methods , bootstrap , samples n instances replacement dataset , used assess model accuracy . [ 90 ] In addition overall accuracy , investigators frequently report sensitivity specificity meaning True Positive Rate ( TPR ) True Negative Rate ( TNR ) respectively . Similarly , investigators sometimes report False Positive Rate ( FPR ) well False Negative Rate ( FNR ) . However , rates ratios fail reveal numerators denominators . The Total Operating Characteristic ( TOC ) effective method express model 's diagnostic ability . TOC shows numerators denominators previously mentioned rates , thus TOC provides information commonly used Receiver Operating Characteristic ( ROC ) ROC 's associated Area Under Curve ( AUC ) . [ 91 ] Ethics [ edit ] Machine learning poses host ethical questions . Systems trained datasets collected biases may exhibit biases upon use ( algorithmic bias ) , thus digitizing cultural prejudices . [ 92 ] For example , using job hiring data firm racist hiring policies may lead machine learning system duplicating bias scoring job applicants similarity previous successful applicants . [ 93 ] [ 94 ] Responsible collection data documentation algorithmic rules used system thus critical part machine learning . Because human languages contain biases , machines trained language corpora necessarily also learn biases . [ 95 ] [ 96 ] Other forms ethical challenges , related personal biases , seen health care . There concerns among health care professionals systems might designed public 's interest income-generating machines . This especially true United States long-standing ethical dilemma improving health care , also increasing profits . For example , algorithms could designed provide patients unnecessary tests medication algorithm 's proprietary owners hold stakes . There huge potential machine learning health care provide professionals great tool diagnose , medicate , even plan recovery paths patients , happen personal biases mentioned previously , `` greed '' biases addressed . [ 97 ] Hardware [ edit ] Since 2010s , advances machine learning algorithms computer hardware led efficient methods training deep neural networks ( particular narrow subdomain machine learning ) contain many layers non-linear hidden units . [ 98 ] By 2019 , graphic processing units ( GPUs ) , often AI-specific enhancements , displaced CPUs dominant method training large-scale commercial cloud AI . [ 99 ] OpenAI estimated hardware compute used largest deep learning projects AlexNet ( 2012 ) AlphaZero ( 2017 ) , found 300,000-fold increase amount compute required , doubling-time trendline 3.4 months .
