The term `` data mining '' was used in a similarly critical way by economist Michael Lovell in an article published in the Review of Economic Studies in 1983 . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Lovell indicates that the practice `` masquerades under a variety of aliases , ranging from `` experimentation '' ( positive ) to `` fishing '' or `` snooping '' ( negative ) . The term data mining appeared around 1990 in the database community , generally with positive connotations . For a short time in 1980s , a phrase `` database mining '' ™ , was used , but since it was trademarked by HNC , a San Diego-based company , to pitch their Database Mining Workstation ; [ 13 ] researchers consequently turned to data mining . Other terms used include data archaeology , information harvesting , information discovery , knowledge extraction , etc . Gregory Piatetsky-Shapiro coined the term `` knowledge discovery in databases '' for the first workshop on the same topic ( KDD-1989 ) and this term became more popular in AI and machine learning community . However , the term data mining became more popular in the business and press communities . [ 14 ] Currently , the terms data mining and knowledge discovery are used interchangeably . In the academic community , the major forums for research started in 1995 when the First International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery ( KDD-95 ) was started in Montreal under AAAI sponsorship . It was co-chaired by Usama Fayyad and Ramasamy Uthurusamy . A year later , in 1996 , Usama Fayyad launched the journal by Kluwer called Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery as its founding editor-in-chief . Later he started the SIGKDD Newsletter SIGKDD Explorations . [ 15 ] The KDD International conference became the primary highest quality conference in data mining with an acceptance rate of research paper submissions below 18 % . The journal Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery is the primary research journal of the field . Background [ edit ] The manual extraction of patterns from data has occurred for centuries . Early methods of identifying patterns in data include Bayes ' theorem ( 1700s ) and regression analysis ( 1800s ) . The proliferation , ubiquity and increasing power of computer technology have dramatically increased data collection , storage , and manipulation ability . As data sets have grown in size and complexity , direct `` hands-on '' data analysis has increasingly been augmented with indirect , automated data processing , aided by other discoveries in computer science , specially in the field of machine learning , such as neural networks , cluster analysis , genetic algorithms ( 1950s ) , decision trees and decision rules ( 1960s ) , and support vector machines ( 1990s ) . Data mining is the process of applying these methods with the intention of uncovering hidden patterns . [ 16 ] in large data sets . It bridges the gap from applied statistics and artificial intelligence ( which usually provide the mathematical background ) to database management by exploiting the way data is stored and indexed in databases to execute the actual learning and discovery algorithms more efficiently , allowing such methods to be applied to ever-larger data sets . Process [ edit ] The knowledge discovery in databases ( KDD ) process is commonly defined with the stages : Selection Pre-processing Transformation Data mining Interpretation/evaluation . [ 5 ] It exists , however , in many variations on this theme , such as the Cross-industry standard process for data mining ( CRISP-DM ) which defines six phases : Business understanding Data understanding Data preparation Modeling Evaluation Deployment or a simplified process such as ( 1 ) Pre-processing , ( 2 ) Data Mining , and ( 3 ) Results Validation . Polls conducted in 2002 , 2004 , 2007 and 2014 show that the CRISP-DM methodology is the leading methodology used by data miners . [ 17 ] The only other data mining standard named in these polls was SEMMA . However , 3–4 times as many people reported using CRISP-DM . Several teams of researchers have published reviews of data mining process models , [ 18 ] and Azevedo and Santos conducted a comparison of CRISP-DM and SEMMA in 2008 . [ 19 ] Pre-processing [ edit ] Before data mining algorithms can be used , a target data set must be assembled . As data mining can only uncover patterns actually present in the data , the target data set must be large enough to contain these patterns while remaining concise enough to be mined within an acceptable time limit . A common source for data is a data mart or data warehouse . Pre-processing is essential to analyze the multivariate data sets before data mining . The target set is then cleaned . Data cleaning removes the observations containing noise and those with missing data . Data mining [ edit ] Data mining involves six common classes of tasks : [ 5 ] Anomaly detection ( outlier/change/deviation detection ) – The identification of unusual data records , that might be interesting or data errors that require further investigation . Association rule learning ( dependency modeling ) – Searches for relationships between variables . For example , a supermarket might gather data on customer purchasing habits . Using association rule learning , the supermarket can determine which products are frequently bought together and use this information for marketing purposes . This is sometimes referred to as market basket analysis . Clustering – is the task of discovering groups and structures in the data that are in some way or another `` similar '' , without using known structures in the data . Classification – is the task of generalizing known structure to apply to new data . For example , an e-mail program might attempt to classify an e-mail as `` legitimate '' or as `` spam '' . Regression – attempts to find a function that models the data with the least error that is , for estimating the relationships among data or datasets . Summarization – providing a more compact representation of the data set , including visualization and report generation . Results validation [ edit ] An example of data produced by data dredging through a bot operated by statistician Tyler Vigen , apparently showing a close link between the best word winning a spelling bee competition and the number of people in the United States killed by venomous spiders . The similarity in trends is obviously a coincidence . Data mining can unintentionally be misused , and can then produce results that appear to be significant ; but which do not actually predict future behavior and can not be reproduced on a new sample of data and bear little use . Often this results from investigating too many hypotheses and not performing proper statistical hypothesis testing . A simple version of this problem in machine learning is known as overfitting , but the same problem can arise at different phases of the process and thus a train/test split—when applicable at all—may not be sufficient to prevent this from happening . [ 20 ] This section is missing information about non-classification tasks in data mining . It only covers machine learning . Please expand the section to include this information . Further details may exist on the talk page . ( September 2011 ) The final step of knowledge discovery from data is to verify that the patterns produced by the data mining algorithms occur in the wider data set . Not all patterns found by data mining algorithms are necessarily valid . It is common for data mining algorithms to find patterns in the training set which are not present in the general data set . This is called overfitting . To overcome this , the evaluation uses a test set of data on which the data mining algorithm was not trained . The learned patterns are applied to this test set , and the resulting output is compared to the desired output . For example , a data mining algorithm trying to distinguish `` spam '' from `` legitimate '' emails would be trained on a training set of sample e-mails . Once trained , the learned patterns would be applied to the test set of e-mails on which it had not been trained . The accuracy of the patterns can then be measured from how many e-mails they correctly classify . Several statistical methods may be used to evaluate the algorithm , such as ROC curves . If the learned patterns do not meet the desired standards , subsequently it is necessary to re-evaluate and change the pre-processing and data mining steps . If the learned patterns do meet the desired standards , then the final step is to interpret the learned patterns and turn them into knowledge . Research [ edit ] The premier professional body in the field is the Association for Computing Machinery 's ( ACM ) Special Interest Group ( SIG ) on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining ( SIGKDD ) . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Since 1989 , this ACM SIG has hosted an annual international conference and published its proceedings , [ 23 ] and since 1999 it has published a biannual academic journal titled `` SIGKDD Explorations '' . [ 24 ] Computer science conferences on data mining include : CIKM Conference – ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge Management European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases KDD Conference – ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining Data mining topics are also present on many data management/database conferences such as the ICDE Conference , SIGMOD Conference and International Conference on Very Large Data Bases Standards [ edit ] There have been some efforts to define standards for the data mining process , for example , the 1999 European Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining ( CRISP-DM 1.0 ) and the 2004 Java Data Mining standard ( JDM 1.0 ) . Development on successors to these processes ( CRISP-DM 2.0 and JDM 2.0 ) was active in 2006 but has stalled since . JDM 2.0 was withdrawn without reaching a final draft . For exchanging the extracted models—in particular for use in predictive analytics—the key standard is the Predictive Model Markup Language ( PMML ) , which is an XML-based language developed by the Data Mining Group ( DMG ) and supported as exchange format by many data mining applications . As the name suggests , it only covers prediction models , a particular data mining task of high importance to business applications . However , extensions to cover ( for example ) subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the DMG . [ 25 ] Notable uses [ edit ] Main article : Examples of data mining See also : Category : Applied data mining . Data mining is used wherever there is digital data available today . Notable examples of data mining can be found throughout business , medicine , science , and surveillance . Privacy concerns and ethics [ edit ] While the term `` data mining '' itself may have no ethical implications , it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples ' behavior ( ethical and otherwise ) . [ 26 ] The ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy , legality , and ethics . [ 27 ] In particular , data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes , such as in the Total Information Awareness Program or in ADVISE , has raised privacy concerns . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Data mining requires data preparation which uncovers information or patterns which compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations . A common way for this to occur is through data aggregation . Data aggregation involves combining data together ( possibly from various sources ) in a way that facilitates analysis ( but that also might make identification of private , individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent ) . [ 30 ] This is not data mining per se , but a result of the preparation of data before—and for the purposes of—the analysis . The threat to an individual 's privacy comes into play when the data , once compiled , cause the data miner , or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set , to be able to identify specific individuals , especially when the data were originally anonymous . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] It is recommended [ according to whom ? ] to be aware of the following before data are collected : [ 30 ] The purpose of the data collection and any ( known ) data mining projects ; How the data will be used ; Who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives ; The status of security surrounding access to the data ; How collected data can be updated . Data may also be modified so as to become anonymous , so that individuals may not readily be identified . [ 30 ] However , even `` anonymized '' data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals , as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL . [ 34 ] The inadvertent revelation of personally identifiable information leading to the provider violates Fair Information Practices . This indiscretion can cause financial , emotional , or bodily harm to the indicated individual . In one instance of privacy violation , the patrons of Walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for selling prescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the data to pharmaceutical companies . [ 35 ] Situation in Europe [ edit ] Europe has rather strong privacy laws , and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers . However , the U.S.–E.U . Safe Harbor Principles , developed between 1998 and 2000 , currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by U.S. companies . As a consequence of Edward Snowden 's global surveillance disclosure , there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement , as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the National Security Agency , and attempts to reach an agreement with the United States have failed . [ 36 ] Situation in the United States [ edit ] In the United States , privacy concerns have been addressed by the US Congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . The HIPAA requires individuals to give their `` informed consent '' regarding information they provide "

      "and its intended present and future uses . According to an article in Biotech Business Week , `` ' [ i ] n practice , HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena , ' says the AAHC . More importantly , the rule 's goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals . `` [ 37 ] This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices . U.S. information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses . The use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the U.S. is not controlled by any legislation . Copyright law [ edit ] Situation in Europe [ edit ] Under European copyright and database laws , the mining of in-copyright works ( such as by web mining ) without the permission of the copyright owner is not legal . Where a database is pure data in Europe , it may be that there is no copyright—but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to intellectual property owners ' rights that are protected by the Database Directive . On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review , this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception . [ 38 ] The UK was the second country in the world to do so after Japan , which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining . However , due to the restriction of the Information Society Directive ( 2001 ) , the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes . UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions . The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013 , under the title of Licences for Europe . [ 39 ] The focus on the solution to this legal issue , such as licensing rather than limitations and exceptions , led to representatives of universities , researchers , libraries , civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013 . [ 40 ] Situation in the United States [ edit ] US copyright law , and in particular its provision for fair use , upholds the legality of content mining in America , and other fair use countries such as Israel , Taiwan and South Korea . As content mining is transformative , that is it does not supplant the original work , it is viewed as being lawful under fair use . For example , as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google 's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful , in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one being text and data mining .

However , extensions to cover ( for example ) subspace clustering have been proposed independently of the DMG . [ 25 ] Notable uses [ edit ] Main article : Examples of data mining See also : Category : Applied data mining . Data mining is used wherever there is digital data available today . Notable examples of data mining can be found throughout business , medicine , science , and surveillance . Privacy concerns and ethics [ edit ] While the term `` data mining '' itself may have no ethical implications , it is often associated with the mining of information in relation to peoples ' behavior ( ethical and otherwise ) . [ 26 ] The ways in which data mining can be used can in some cases and contexts raise questions regarding privacy , legality , and ethics . [ 27 ] In particular , data mining government or commercial data sets for national security or law enforcement purposes , such as in the Total Information Awareness Program or in ADVISE , has raised privacy concerns . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Data mining requires data preparation which uncovers information or patterns which compromise confidentiality and privacy obligations . A common way for this to occur is through data aggregation . Data aggregation involves combining data together ( possibly from various sources ) in a way that facilitates analysis ( but that also might make identification of private , individual-level data deducible or otherwise apparent ) . [ 30 ] This is not data mining per se , but a result of the preparation of data before—and for the purposes of—the analysis . The threat to an individual 's privacy comes into play when the data , once compiled , cause the data miner , or anyone who has access to the newly compiled data set , to be able to identify specific individuals , especially when the data were originally anonymous . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] It is recommended [ according to whom ? ] to be aware of the following before data are collected : [ 30 ] The purpose of the data collection and any ( known ) data mining projects ; How the data will be used ; Who will be able to mine the data and use the data and their derivatives ; The status of security surrounding access to the data ; How collected data can be updated . Data may also be modified so as to become anonymous , so that individuals may not readily be identified . [ 30 ] However , even `` anonymized '' data sets can potentially contain enough information to allow identification of individuals , as occurred when journalists were able to find several individuals based on a set of search histories that were inadvertently released by AOL . [ 34 ] The inadvertent revelation of personally identifiable information leading to the provider violates Fair Information Practices . This indiscretion can cause financial , emotional , or bodily harm to the indicated individual . In one instance of privacy violation , the patrons of Walgreens filed a lawsuit against the company in 2011 for selling prescription information to data mining companies who in turn provided the data to pharmaceutical companies . [ 35 ] Situation in Europe [ edit ] Europe has rather strong privacy laws , and efforts are underway to further strengthen the rights of the consumers . However , the U.S.–E.U . Safe Harbor Principles , developed between 1998 and 2000 , currently effectively expose European users to privacy exploitation by U.S. companies . As a consequence of Edward Snowden 's global surveillance disclosure , there has been increased discussion to revoke this agreement , as in particular the data will be fully exposed to the National Security Agency , and attempts to reach an agreement with the United States have failed . [ 36 ] Situation in the United States [ edit ] In the United States , privacy concerns have been addressed by the US Congress via the passage of regulatory controls such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act ( HIPAA ) . The HIPAA requires individuals to give their `` informed consent '' regarding information they provide and its intended present and future uses . According to an article in Biotech Business Week , `` ' [ i ] n practice , HIPAA may not offer any greater protection than the longstanding regulations in the research arena , ' says the AAHC . More importantly , the rule 's goal of protection through informed consent is approach a level of incomprehensibility to average individuals . `` [ 37 ] This underscores the necessity for data anonymity in data aggregation and mining practices . U.S. information privacy legislation such as HIPAA and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ( FERPA ) applies only to the specific areas that each such law addresses . The use of data mining by the majority of businesses in the U.S. is not controlled by any legislation . Copyright law [ edit ] Situation in Europe [ edit ] Under European copyright and database laws , the mining of in-copyright works ( such as by web mining ) without the "

      "permission of the copyright owner is not legal . Where a database is pure data in Europe , it may be that there is no copyright—but database rights may exist so data mining becomes subject to intellectual property owners ' rights that are protected by the Database Directive . On the recommendation of the Hargreaves review , this led to the UK government to amend its copyright law in 2014 to allow content mining as a limitation and exception . [ 38 ] The UK was the second country in the world to do so after Japan , which introduced an exception in 2009 for data mining . However , due to the restriction of the Information Society Directive ( 2001 ) , the UK exception only allows content mining for non-commercial purposes . UK copyright law also does not allow this provision to be overridden by contractual terms and conditions . The European Commission facilitated stakeholder discussion on text and data mining in 2013 , under the title of Licences for Europe . [ 39 ] The focus on the solution to this legal issue , such as licensing rather than limitations and exceptions , led to representatives of universities , researchers , libraries , civil society groups and open access publishers to leave the stakeholder dialogue in May 2013 . [ 40 ] Situation in the United States [ edit ] US copyright law , and in particular its provision for fair use , upholds the legality of content mining in America , and other fair use countries such as Israel , Taiwan and South Korea . As content mining is transformative , that is it does not supplant the original work , it is viewed as being lawful under fair use . For example , as part of the Google Book settlement the presiding judge on the case ruled that Google 's digitization project of in-copyright books was lawful , in part because of the transformative uses that the digitization project displayed—one being text and data mining .

( Rossum 's Universal Robots ) . [ 28 ] These characters and their fates raised many of the same issues now discussed in the ethics of artificial intelligence . [ 22 ] The study of mechanical or `` formal '' reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity . The study of mathematical logic led directly to Alan Turing 's theory of computation , which suggested that a machine , by shuffling symbols as simple as `` 0 '' and `` 1 '' , could simulate any conceivable act of mathematical deduction . This insight , that digital computers can simulate any process of formal reasoning , is known as the Church–Turing thesis . [ 29 ] Along with concurrent discoveries in neurobiology , information theory and cybernetics , this led researchers to consider the possibility of building an electronic brain . Turing proposed changing the question from whether a machine was intelligent , to `` whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour '' . [ 30 ] The first work that is now generally recognized as AI was McCullouch and Pitts ' 1943 formal design for Turing-complete `` artificial neurons '' . [ 31 ] The field of AI research was born at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956 , [ 32 ] where the term `` Artificial Intelligence '' was coined by John McCarthy to distinguish the field from cybernetics and escape the influence of the cyberneticist Norbert Wiener . [ 33 ] Attendees Allen Newell ( CMU ) , Herbert Simon ( CMU ) , John McCarthy ( MIT ) , Marvin Minsky ( MIT ) and Arthur Samuel ( IBM ) became the founders and leaders of AI research . [ 34 ] They and their students produced programs that the press described as `` astonishing '' : [ 35 ] computers were learning checkers strategies ( c. 1954 ) [ 36 ] ( and by 1959 were reportedly playing better than the average human ) , [ 37 ] solving word problems in algebra , proving logical theorems ( Logic Theorist , first run c. 1956 ) and speaking English . [ 38 ] By the middle of the 1960s , research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense [ 39 ] and laboratories had been established around the world . [ 40 ] AI 's founders were optimistic about the future : Herbert Simon predicted , `` machines will be capable , within twenty years , of doing any work a man can do '' . Marvin Minsky agreed , writing , `` within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence ' will substantially be solved '' . [ 10 ] They failed to recognize the difficulty of some of the remaining tasks . Progress slowed and in 1974 , in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill [ 41 ] and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects , both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in AI . The next few years would later be called an `` AI winter '' , [ 12 ] a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult . In the early 1980s , AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems , [ 42 ] a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts . By 1985 , the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars . At the same time , Japan 's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S and British governments to restore funding for academic research . [ 11 ] However , beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987 , AI once again fell into disrepute , and a second , longer-lasting hiatus began . [ 13 ] The development of metal–oxide–semiconductor ( MOS ) very-large-scale integration ( VLSI ) , in the form of complementary MOS ( CMOS ) transistor technology , enabled the development of practical artificial neural network ( ANN ) technology in the 1980s . A landmark publication in the field was the 1989 book Analog VLSI Implementation of Neural Systems by Carver A. Mead and Mohammed Ismail . [ 43 ] In the late 1990s and early 21st century , AI began to be used for logistics , data mining , medical diagnosis and other areas . [ 26 ] The success was due to increasing computational power ( see Moore 's law and transistor count ) , greater emphasis on solving specific problems , new ties between AI and other fields ( such as statistics , economics and mathematics ) , and a commitment by researchers to mathematical methods and scientific standards . [ 44 ] Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion , Garry Kasparov , on 11 May 1997 . [ 45 ] In 2011 , a Jeopardy ! quiz show exhibition match , IBM 's question answering system , Watson , defeated the two greatest Jeopardy ! champions , Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings , by a significant margin . [ 46 ] Faster computers , algorithmic improvements , and access to large amounts of data enabled advances in machine learning and perception ; data-hungry deep learning methods started to dominate accuracy benchmarks around 2012 . [ 47 ] The Kinect , which provides a 3D body–motion interface for the Xbox 360 and the Xbox One , uses algorithms that emerged from lengthy AI research [ 48 ] as do intelligent personal assistants in smartphones . [ 49 ] In March 2016 , AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol , becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps . [ 8 ] [ 50 ] In the 2017 Future of Go Summit , AlphaGo won a three-game match with Ke Jie , [ 51 ] who at the time continuously held the world No . 1 ranking for two years . [ 52 ] [ 53 ] This marked the completion of a significant milestone in the development of Artificial Intelligence as Go is a relatively complex game , more so than Chess . According to Bloomberg 's Jack Clark , 2015 was a landmark year for artificial intelligence , with the number of software projects that use AI within Google increased from a `` sporadic usage '' in 2012 to more than 2,700 projects . Clark also presents factual data indicating the improvements of AI since 2012 supported by lower error rates in image processing tasks . [ 54 ] He attributes this to an increase in affordable neural networks , due to a rise in cloud computing infrastructure and to an increase in research tools and datasets . [ 14 ] Other cited examples include Microsoft 's development of a Skype system that can automatically translate from one language to another and Facebook 's system that can describe images to blind people . [ 54 ] In a 2017 survey , one in five companies reported they had `` incorporated AI in some offerings or processes '' . [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Around 2016 , China greatly accelerated its government funding ; given its large supply of data and its rapidly increasing research output , some observers believe it may be on track to becoming an `` AI superpower '' . [ 57 ] [ 58 ] However , it has been acknowledged that reports regarding artificial intelligence have tended to be exaggerated . [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] Basics Computer science defines AI research as the study of `` intelligent agents '' : any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals . [ 1 ] A more elaborate definition characterizes AI as `` a system 's ability to correctly interpret external data , to learn from such data , and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation . `` [ 62 ] A typical AI analyzes its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success . [ 1 ] An AI 's intended utility function ( or goal ) can be simple ( `` 1 if the AI wins a game of Go , 0 otherwise '' ) or complex ( `` Perform actions mathematically similar to ones that succeeded in the past '' ) . Goals can be explicitly defined or induced . If the AI is programmed for `` reinforcement learning '' , goals can be implicitly induced by rewarding some types of behavior or punishing others . [ a ] Alternatively , an evolutionary system can induce goals by using a `` fitness function '' to mutate and preferentially replicate high-scoring AI systems , similar to how animals evolved to innately desire certain goals such as finding food . [ 63 ] Some AI systems , such as nearest-neighbor , instead of reason by analogy , these systems are not generally given goals , except to the degree that goals are implicit in their training data . [ 64 ] Such systems can still be benchmarked if the non-goal system is framed as a system whose `` goal '' is to successfully accomplish its narrow classification task . [ 65 ] AI often revolves around the use of algorithms . An algorithm is a set of unambiguous instructions that a mechanical computer can execute . [ b ] A complex algorithm is often built on top of other , simpler , algorithms . A simple example of an algorithm is the following ( optimal for first player ) recipe for play at tic-tac-toe : [ 66 ] If someone has a `` threat '' ( that is , two in a row ) , take the remaining square . Otherwise , if a move `` forks '' to create two threats at once , play that move . Otherwise , take the center square if it is free . Otherwise , if your opponent has played in a corner , take the opposite corner . Otherwise , take an empty corner if one exists . Otherwise , take any empty square . Many AI algorithms are capable of learning from data ; they can enhance themselves by learning new heuristics ( strategies , or `` rules of thumb '' , that have worked well in the past ) , or can themselves write other algorithms . Some of the `` learners '' described below , including Bayesian networks , decision trees , and nearest-neighbor , could theoretically , ( given infinite data , time , and memory ) learn to approximate any function , including which combination of mathematical functions would best describe the world . [ citation needed ] These learners could therefore derive all possible knowledge , by considering every possible hypothesis and matching them against the data . In practice , it is seldom possible to consider every possibility , because of the phenomenon of `` combinatorial explosion '' , where the time needed to solve a problem grows exponentially . Much of AI research involves figuring out how to identify and avoid considering a broad range of possibilities unlikely to be beneficial . [ 67 ] [ 68 ] For example , when viewing a map and looking for the shortest driving route from Denver to New York in the East , one can in most cases skip looking at any path through San Francisco or other areas far to the West ; thus , an AI wielding a pathfinding algorithm like A * can avoid the combinatorial explosion that would ensue if every possible route had to be ponderously considered . [ 69 ] The earliest ( and easiest to understand ) approach to AI was symbolism ( such as formal logic ) : `` If an otherwise healthy adult has a fever , then they may have influenza '' . A second , more general , approach is Bayesian inference : `` If the current patient has a fever , adjust the probability they have influenza in such-and-such way '' . The third major approach , extremely popular in routine business AI applications , are analogizers such as SVM and nearest-neighbor : `` After examining the records of known past patients whose temperature , symptoms , age , and other factors mostly match the current patient , X % of those patients turned out to have influenza '' . A fourth approach is harder to intuitively understand , but is inspired by how the brain 's machinery works : the artificial neural network approach uses artificial `` neurons '' that can learn by comparing itself to the desired output and altering the strengths of the connections between its internal neurons to `` reinforce '' connections that seemed to be useful . These four main approaches can overlap"

      " with each other and with evolutionary systems ; for example , neural nets can learn to make inferences , to generalize , and to make analogies . Some systems implicitly or explicitly use multiple of these approaches , alongside many other AI and non-AI algorithms ; the best approach is often different depending on the problem . [ 70 ] [ 71 ] Learning algorithms work on the basis that strategies , algorithms , and inferences that worked well in the past are likely to continue working well in the future . These inferences can be obvious , such as `` since the sun rose every morning for the last 10,000 days , it will probably rise tomorrow morning as well '' . They can be nuanced , such as `` X % of families have geographically separate species with color variants , so there is a Y % chance that undiscovered black swans exist '' . Learners also work on the basis of `` Occam 's razor '' : The simplest theory that explains the data is the likeliest . Therefore , according to Occam 's razor principle , a learner must be designed such that it prefers simpler theories to complex theories , except in cases where the complex theory is proven substantially better . The blue line could be an example of overfitting a linear function due to random noise . Settling on a bad , overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting . Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data , but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is . [ 72 ] Besides classic overfitting , learners can also disappoint by `` learning the wrong lesson '' . A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses . [ 73 ] A real-world example is that , unlike humans , current image classifiers do n't determine the spatial relationship between components of the picture ; instead , they learn abstract patterns of pixels that humans are oblivious to , but that linearly correlate with images of certain types of real objects . Faintly superimposing such a pattern on a legitimate image results in an `` adversarial '' image that the system misclassifies . [ c ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] A self-driving car system may use a neural network to determine which parts of the picture seem to match previous training images of pedestrians , and then model those areas as slow-moving but somewhat unpredictable rectangular prisms that must be avoided . [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Compared with humans , existing AI lacks several features of human `` commonsense reasoning '' ; most notably , humans have powerful mechanisms for reasoning about `` naïve physics '' such as space , time , and physical interactions . This enables even young children to easily make inferences like `` If I roll this pen off a table , it will fall on the floor '' . Humans also have a powerful mechanism of `` folk psychology '' that helps them to interpret natural-language sentences such as `` The city councilmen refused the demonstrators a permit because they advocated violence '' ( A generic AI has difficulty discerning whether the ones alleged to be advocating violence are the councilmen or the demonstrators [ 79 ] [ 80 ] [ 81 ] ) . This lack of `` common knowledge '' means that AI often makes different mistakes than humans make , in ways that can seem incomprehensible . For example , existing self-driving cars can not reason about the location nor the intentions of pedestrians in the exact way that humans do , and instead must use non-human modes of reasoning to avoid accidents . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] Challenges The cognitive capabilities of current architectures are very limited , using only a simplified version of what intelligence is really capable of . For instance , the human mind has come up with ways to reason beyond measure and logical explanations to different occurrences in life . What would have been otherwise straightforward , an equivalently difficult problem may be challenging to solve computationally as opposed to using the human mind . This gives rise to two classes of models : structuralist and functionalist . The structural models aim to loosely mimic the basic intelligence operations of the mind such as reasoning and logic . The functional model refers to the correlating data to its computed counterpart . [ 85 ] The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner . The general problem of simulating ( or creating ) intelligence has been broken down into sub-problems . These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display . The traits described below have received the most attention . [ 16 ] Reasoning , problem solving Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions . [ 86 ] By the late 1980s and 1990s , AI research had developed methods for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information , employing concepts from probability and economics . [ 87 ] These algorithms proved to be insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experienced a `` combinatorial explosion '' : they became exponentially slower as the problems grew larger . [ 67 ] Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model . They solve most of their problems using fast , intuitive judgments . [ 88 ] Knowledge representation An ontology represents knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts . Main articles : Knowledge representation and Commonsense knowledge Knowledge representation [ 89 ] and knowledge engineering [ 90 ] are central to classical AI research . Some `` expert systems '' attempt to gather explicit knowledge possessed by experts in some narrow domain . In addition , some projects attempt to gather the `` commonsense knowledge '' known to the average person into a database containing extensive knowledge about the world . Among the things a comprehensive commonsense knowledge base would contain are : objects , properties , categories and relations between objects ; [ 91 ] situations , events , states and time ; [ 92 ] causes and effects ; [ 93 ] knowledge about knowledge ( what we know about what other people know ) ; [ 94 ] and many other , less well researched domains . A representation of `` what exists '' is an ontology : the set of objects , relations , concepts , and properties formally described so that software agents can interpret them . The semantics of these are captured as description logic concepts , roles , and individuals , and typically implemented as classes , properties , and individuals in the Web Ontology Language . [ 95 ] The most general ontologies are called upper ontologies , which attempt to provide a foundation for all other knowledge [ 96 ] by acting as mediators between domain ontologies that cover specific knowledge about a particular knowledge domain ( field of interest or area of concern ) . Such formal knowledge representations can be used in content-based indexing and retrieval , [ 97 ] scene interpretation , [ 98 ] clinical decision support , [ 99 ] knowledge discovery ( mining `` interesting '' and actionable inferences from large databases ) , [ 100 ] and other areas . [ 101 ] Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are : Default reasoning and the qualification problem Many of the things people know take the form of `` working assumptions '' . For example , if a bird comes up in conversation , people typically picture a fist-sized animal that sings and flies . None of these things are true about all birds . John McCarthy identified this problem in 1969 [ 102 ] as the qualification problem : for any commonsense rule that AI researchers care to represent , there tend to be a huge number of exceptions . Almost nothing is simply true or false in the way that abstract logic requires . AI research has explored a number of solutions to this problem . [ 103 ] Breadth of commonsense knowledge The number of atomic facts that the average person knows is very large . Research projects that attempt to build a complete knowledge base of commonsense knowledge ( e.g. , Cyc ) require enormous amounts of laborious ontological engineering—they must be built , by hand , one complicated concept at a time . [ 104 ] Subsymbolic form of some commonsense knowledge Much of what people know is not represented as `` facts '' or `` statements '' that they could express verbally . For example , a chess master will avoid a particular chess position because it `` feels too exposed '' [ 105 ] or an art critic can take one look at a statue and realize that it is a fake . [ 106 ] These are non-conscious and sub-symbolic intuitions or tendencies in the human brain . [ 107 ] Knowledge like this informs , supports and provides a context for symbolic , conscious knowledge . As with the related problem of sub-symbolic reasoning , it is hoped that situated AI , computational intelligence , or statistical AI will provide ways to represent this knowledge . [ 107 ] Planning A hierarchical control system is a form of control system in which a set of devices and governing software is arranged in a hierarchy . Main article : Automated planning and scheduling Intelligent agents must be able to set goals and achieve them . [ 108 ] They need a way to visualize the future—a representation of the state of the world and be able to make predictions about how their actions will change it—and be able to make choices that maximize the utility ( or `` value '' ) of available choices . [ 109 ] In classical planning problems , the agent can assume that it is the only system acting in the world , allowing the agent to be certain of the consequences of its actions . "

      "Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories , depending on the nature of the `` signal '' or `` feedback '' available to the learning system : Supervised learning : The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs , given by a `` teacher '' , and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs . Unsupervised learning : No labels are given to the learning algorithm , leaving it on its own to find structure in its input . Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself ( discovering hidden patterns in data ) or a means towards an end ( feature learning ) . Reinforcement learning : A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal ( such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent ) . As it navigates its problem space , the program is provided feedback that 's analogous to rewards , which it tries to maximize . [ 4 ] Other approaches have been developed which do n't fit neatly into this three-fold categorisation , and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system . For example topic modeling , dimensionality reduction or meta learning . [ 9 ] As of 2020 , deep learning has become the dominant approach for much ongoing work in the field of machine learning . [ 7 ] History and relationships to other fields [ edit ] See also : Timeline of machine learning The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel , an American IBMer and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] A representative book of the machine learning research during the 1960s was the Nilsson 's book on Learning Machines , dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification . [ 12 ] Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s , as described by Duda and Hart in 1973 . [ 13 ] In 1981 a report was given on using teaching strategies so that a neural network learns to recognize 40 characters ( 26 letters , 10 digits , and 4 special symbols ) from a computer terminal . [ 14 ] Tom M. Mitchell provided a widely quoted , more formal definition of the algorithms studied in the machine learning field : `` A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P if its performance at tasks in T , as measured by P , improves with experience E. '' [ 15 ] This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms . This follows Alan Turing 's proposal in his paper `` Computing Machinery and Intelligence '' , in which the question `` Can machines think ? '' is replaced with the question `` Can machines do what we ( as thinking entities ) can do ? '' . [ 16 ] Artificial intelligence [ edit ] As a scientific endeavor , machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence . In the early days of AI as an academic discipline , some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data . They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods , as well as what were then termed `` neural networks '' ; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics . [ 17 ] Probabilistic reasoning was also employed , especially in automated medical diagnosis . [ 18 ] :488 However , an increasing emphasis on the logical , knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning . Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation . [ 18 ] :488 By 1980 , expert systems had come to dominate AI , and statistics was out of favor . [ 19 ] Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI , leading to inductive logic programming , but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper , in pattern recognition and information retrieval . [ 18 ] :708–710 ; 755 Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time . This line , too , was continued outside the AI/CS field , as `` connectionism '' , by researchers from other disciplines including Hopfield , Rumelhart and Hinton . Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation . [ 18 ] :25 Machine learning , reorganized as a separate field , started to flourish in the 1990s . The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature . It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI , and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics and probability theory . [ 19 ] As of 2019 , many sources continue to assert that machine learning remains a subfield of AI . Yet some practitioners , for example Dr Daniel Hulme , who teaches AI and runs a company operating in the field , argues that machine learning and AI are separate . [ 8 ] [ 20 ] [ 7 ] Data mining [ edit ] Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly , but while machine learning focuses on prediction , based on known properties learned from the training data , data mining focuses on the discovery of ( previously ) unknown properties in the data ( this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases ) . Data mining uses many machine learning methods , but with different goals ; on the other hand , machine learning also employs data mining methods as `` unsupervised learning '' or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy . Much of the confusion between these two research communities ( which do often have separate conferences and separate journals , ECML PKDD being a major exception ) comes from the basic assumptions they work with : in machine learning , performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge , while in knowledge discovery and data mining ( KDD ) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge . Evaluated with respect to known knowledge , an uninformed ( unsupervised ) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods , while in a typical KDD task , supervised methods can not be used due to the unavailability of training data . Optimization [ edit ] Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization : many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples . Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances ( for example , in classification , one wants to assign a label to instances , and models are trained to correctly predict the pre-assigned labels of a set of examples ) . The difference between the two fields arises from the goal of generalization : while optimization algorithms can minimize the loss on a training set , machine learning is concerned with minimizing the loss on unseen samples . [ 21 ] Statistics [ edit ] Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods , but distinct in their principal goal : statistics draws population inferences from a sample , while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns . [ 22 ] According to Michael I. Jordan , the ideas of machine learning , from methodological principles to theoretical tools , have had a long pre-history in statistics . [ 23 ] He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field . [ 23 ] Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms : data model and algorithmic model , [ 24 ] wherein `` algorithmic model '' means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random forest . Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning , leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning . [ 25 ] Theory [ edit ] Main articles : Computational learning theory and Statistical learning theory A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience . [ 4 ] [ 26 ] Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new , unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set . The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution ( considered representative of the space of occurrences ) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases . The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory . Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain , learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms . Instead , probabilistic bounds on the performance are quite common . The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error . For the best performance in the context of generalization , the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data . If the hypothesis is less complex than the function , then the model has under fitted the data . If the complexity of the model is increased in response , then the training error decreases . But if the hypothesis is too complex , then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer . [ 27 ] In addition to performance bounds , learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning . In computational learning theory , a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time . There are two kinds of time complexity results . Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time . Negative results show that certain classes can not be learned in polynomial time . Approaches [ edit ] Types of learning algorithms [ edit ] The types of machine learning algorithms differ in their approach , the type of data they input and output , and the type of task or problem that they are intended to solve . Supervised learning [ edit ] Main article : Supervised learning A support vector machine is a supervised learning model that divides the data into regions separated by a linear boundary . Here , the linear boundary divides the black circles from the white . Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs . [ 28 ] The data is known as training data , and consists of a set of training examples . Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output , also known as a supervisory signal . In the mathematical model , each training example is represented by an array or vector , sometimes called a feature vector , and the training data is represented by a matrix . Through iterative optimization of an objective function , supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs . [ 29 ] An optimal function will allow the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data . An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task . [ 15 ] Types of supervised learning algorithms include Active learning , classification and regression . [ 30 ] Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values , and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range . As an example , for a classification algorithm that filters emails , the input would be an incoming email , and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email . Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification , but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are . It has applications in ranking , recommendation systems , visual identity tracking , face verification , and speaker verification . Unsupervised learning [ edit ] Main article : Unsupervised learningSee also : Cluster analysis Unsupervised learning algorithms take a set of data that contains only inputs , and find structure in the data , like grouping or clustering of data points . The algorithms , therefore , learn from test data that has not been labeled , classified or categorized . Instead of responding to feedback , unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data . A central application of unsupervised learning is in the field of density estimation in statistics , such as finding the probability density function . [ 31 ] Though unsupervised learning encompasses other domains involving summarizing and explaining data features . Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets ( called clusters ) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria , while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar . Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data , often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated , for example , by internal compactness , or the similarity between members of the same cluster , and separation , the difference between clusters . Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity . Semi-supervised learning [ edit ] Main article : Semi-supervised learning Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning ( without any labeled training data ) and supervised learning ( with completely labeled training data ) . Some of the training examples are missing training labels , yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data , when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data , can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy . In weakly supervised learning , the training labels are noisy , limited , or imprecise ; however , these labels are often cheaper to obtain , resulting in larger effective training sets . [ 32 ] Reinforcement learning [ edit ] Main article : Reinforcement learning Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward . Due to its generality , the field is studied in many other disciplines , such as game theory , control theory , operations research , information theory , simulation-based optimization , multi-agent systems , swarm intelligence , statistics and genetic algorithms . In machine learning , the environment is typically represented as a Markov Decision Process ( MDP ) . Many reinforcement learning algorithms use dynamic programming techniques . [ 33 ] Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP , and are used when exact models are infeasible . Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent . Self learning [ edit ] Self-learning as machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning named Crossbar Adaptive Array ( CAA ) . [ 34 ] It is a learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advices . The CAA self-learning algorithm computes , in a crossbar fashion , both decisions about actions and emotions ( feelings ) about consequence situations . The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion . [ 35 ] The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w ( a , s ) || such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine : In situation s perform action a ; Receive consequence situation s ’ ; Compute emotion of being in consequence situation v ( s ’ ) ; Update crossbar memory w ’ ( a , s ) = w ( a , s ) + v ( s ’ ) . It is a system with only one input , situation s , and only one output , action ( or behavior ) a . There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment . The backpropagated value ( secondary reinforcement ) is the emotion toward the consequence situation . The CAA exists in two environments , one is behavioral environment where it behaves , and the other is genetic environment , wherefrom it initially and only once "

      "receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment . After receiving the genome ( species ) vector from the genetic environment , the CAA learns a goal seeking behavior , in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations . [ 36 ] Feature learning [ edit ] Main article : Feature learning Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training . [ 37 ] Classic examples include principal components analysis and cluster analysis . Feature learning algorithms , also called representation learning algorithms , often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful , often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions . This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution , while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution . This replaces manual feature engineering , and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task . Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised . In supervised feature learning , features are learned using labeled input data . Examples include artificial neural networks , multilayer perceptrons , and supervised dictionary learning . In unsupervised feature learning , features are learned with unlabeled input data . Examples include dictionary learning , independent component analysis , autoencoders , matrix factorization [ 38 ] and various forms of clustering . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional . Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse , meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros . Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data , without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors . [ 42 ] Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation , or a hierarchy of features , with higher-level , more abstract features defined in terms of ( or generating ) lower-level features . It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data . [ 43 ] Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process . However , real-world data such as images , video , and sensory data has not yielded to attempts to algorithmically define specific features . An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination , without relying on explicit algorithms . Sparse dictionary learning [ edit ] Main article : Sparse dictionary learning Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions , and is assumed to be a sparse matrix . The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately . [ 44 ] A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the K-SVD algorithm . Sparse dictionary learning has been applied in several contexts . In classification , the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs . For a dictionary where each class has already been built , a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary . Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising . The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary , but the noise can not . [ 45 ] Anomaly detection [ edit ] Main article : Anomaly detection In data mining , anomaly detection , also known as outlier detection , is the identification of rare items , events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data . [ 46 ] Typically , the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud , a structural defect , medical problems or errors in a text . Anomalies are referred to as outliers , novelties , noise , deviations and exceptions . [ 47 ] In particular , in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection , the interesting objects are often not rare objects , but unexpected bursts in activity . This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object , and many outlier detection methods ( in particular , unsupervised algorithms ) will fail on such data , unless it has been aggregated appropriately . Instead , a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns . [ 48 ] Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist . [ 49 ] Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal , by looking for instances that seem to fit least to the remainder of the data set . Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as `` normal '' and `` abnormal '' and involves training a classifier ( the key difference to many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection ) . Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model . Robot learning [ edit ] In developmental robotics , robot learning algorithms generate their own sequences of learning experiences , also known as a curriculum , to cumulatively acquire new skills through self-guided exploration and social interaction with humans . These robots use guidance mechanisms such as active learning , maturation , motor synergies and imitation . Association rules [ edit ] Main article : Association rule learningSee also : Inductive logic programming Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases . It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of `` interestingness '' . [ 50 ] Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies , learns , or evolves `` rules '' to store , manipulate or apply knowledge . The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system . This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction . [ 51 ] Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems , association rule learning , and artificial immune systems . Based on the concept of strong rules , Rakesh Agrawal , Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale ( POS ) systems in supermarkets . [ 52 ] For example , the rule { o n i o n s , p o t a t o e s } ⇒ { b u r g e r } { \\displaystyle \\ { \\mathrm { onions , potatoes } \\ } \\Rightarrow \\ { \\mathrm { burger } \\ } } found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes "

      "Ancient Egypt . These mines are described by the Greek author Diodorus Siculus , who mentions fire-setting as one method used to break down the hard rock holding the gold . One of the complexes is shown in one of the earliest known maps . The miners crushed the ore and ground it to a fine powder before washing the powder for the gold dust . Ancient Greece and Rome [ edit ] Further information : Mining in Roman Britain Ancient Roman development of the Dolaucothi Gold Mines , Wales Mining in Europe has a very long history . Examples include the silver mines of Laurium , which helped support the Greek city state of Athens . Although they had over 20,000 slaves working them , their technology was essentially identical to their Bronze Age predecessors . [ 9 ] At other mines , such as on the island of Thassos , marble was quarried by the Parians after they arrived in the 7th century BC . [ 10 ] The marble was shipped away and was later found by archaeologists to have been used in buildings including the tomb of Amphipolis . Philip II of Macedon , the father of Alexander the Great , captured the gold mines of Mount Pangeo in 357 BC to fund his military campaigns . [ 11 ] He also captured gold mines in Thrace for minting coinage , eventually producing 26 tons per year . However , it was the Romans who developed large scale mining methods , especially the use of large volumes of water brought to the minehead by numerous aqueducts . The water was used for a variety of purposes , including removing overburden and rock debris , called hydraulic mining , as well as washing comminuted , or crushed , ores and driving simple machinery . The Romans used hydraulic mining methods on a large scale to prospect for the veins of ore , especially a now-obsolete form of mining known as hushing . They built numerous aqueducts to supply water to the minehead . There , the water stored in large reservoirs and tanks . When a full tank was opened , the flood of water sluiced away the overburden to expose the bedrock underneath and any gold veins . The rock was then worked upon by fire-setting to heat the rock , which would be quenched with a stream of water . The resulting thermal shock cracked the rock , enabling it to be removed by further streams of water from the overhead tanks . The Roman miners used similar methods to work cassiterite deposits in Cornwall and lead ore in the Pennines . The methods had been developed by the Romans in Spain in 25 AD to exploit large alluvial gold deposits , the largest site being at Las Medulas , where seven long aqueducts tapped local rivers and sluiced the deposits . The Romans also exploited the silver present in the argentiferous galena in the mines of Cartagena ( Cartago Nova ) , Linares ( Castulo ) , Plasenzuela and Azuaga , among many others . [ 12 ] Spain was one of the most important mining regions , but all regions of the Roman Empire were exploited . In Great Britain the natives had mined minerals for millennia , [ 13 ] but after the Roman conquest , the scale of the operations increased dramatically , as the Romans needed Britannia 's resources , especially gold , silver , tin , and lead . Roman techniques were not limited to surface mining . They followed the ore veins underground once opencast mining was no longer feasible . At Dolaucothi they stoped out the veins and drove adits through bare rock to drain the stopes . The same adits were also used to ventilate the workings , especially important when fire-setting was used . At other parts of the site , they penetrated the water table and dewatered the mines using several kinds of machines , especially reverse overshot water-wheels . These were used extensively in the copper mines at Rio Tinto in Spain , where one sequence comprised 16 such wheels arranged in pairs , and lifting water about 24 metres ( 79 ft ) . They were worked as treadmills with miners standing on the top slats . Many examples of such devices have been found in old Roman mines and some examples are now preserved in the British Museum and the National Museum of Wales . [ 14 ] Medieval Europe [ edit ] Main article : Mining and metallurgy in medieval Europe Agricola , author of De Re Metallica Gallery , 12th to 13th century , Germany Mining as an industry underwent dramatic changes in medieval Europe . The mining industry in the early Middle Ages was mainly focused on the extraction of copper and iron . Other precious metals were also used , mainly for gilding or coinage . Initially , many metals were obtained through open-pit mining , and ore was primarily extracted from shallow depths , rather than through deep mine shafts . Around the 14th century , the growing use of weapons , armour , stirrups , and horseshoes greatly increased the demand for iron . Medieval knights , for example , were often laden with up to 100 pounds ( 45 kg ) of plate or chain link armour in addition to swords , lances and other weapons . [ 15 ] The overwhelming dependency on iron for military purposes spurred iron production and extraction processes . The silver crisis of 1465 occurred when all mines had reached depths at which the shafts could no longer be pumped dry with the available technology . [ 16 ] Although an increased use of banknotes , credit and copper coins during this period did decrease the value of , and dependence on , precious metals , gold and silver still remained vital to the story of medieval mining . Due to differences in the social structure of society , the increasing extraction of mineral deposits spread from central Europe to England in the mid-sixteenth century . On the continent , mineral deposits belonged to the crown , and this regalian right was stoutly maintained . But in England , royal mining rights were restricted to gold and silver ( of which England had virtually no deposits ) by a judicial decision of 1568 and a law in 1688 . England had iron , zinc , copper , lead , and tin ores . Landlords who owned the base metals and coal under their estates then had a strong inducement to extract these metals or to lease the deposits and collect royalties from mine operators . English , German , and Dutch capital combined to finance extraction and refining . Hundreds of German technicians and skilled workers were brought over ; in 1642 a colony of 4,000 foreigners was mining and smelting copper at Keswick in the northwestern mountains . [ 17 ] Use of water power in the form of water mills was extensive . The water mills were employed in crushing ore , raising ore from shafts , and ventilating galleries by powering giant bellows . Black powder was first used in mining in Selmecbánya , Kingdom of Hungary ( now Banská Štiavnica , Slovakia ) in 1627 . [ 18 ] Black powder allowed blasting of rock and earth to loosen and reveal ore veins . Blasting was much faster than fire-setting and allowed the mining of previously impenetrable metals and ores . [ 19 ] In 1762 , the world 's first mining academy was established in the same town there . The widespread adoption of agricultural innovations such as the iron plowshare , as well as the growing use of metal as a building material , was also a driving force in the tremendous growth of the iron industry during this period . Inventions like the arrastra were often used by the Spanish to pulverize ore after being mined . This device was powered by animals and used the same principles used for grain threshing . [ 20 ] Much of the knowledge of medieval mining techniques comes from books such as Biringuccio ’ s De la pirotechnia and probably most importantly from Georg Agricola 's De re metallica ( 1556 ) . These books detail many different mining methods used in German and Saxon mines . A prime issue in medieval mines , which Agricola explains in detail , was the removal of water from mining shafts . As miners dug deeper to access new veins , flooding became a very real obstacle . The mining industry became dramatically more efficient and prosperous with the invention of mechanical and animal driven pumps . The image of a Maharlika class of the Philippine Society , depicted in Boxer Codex that the Gold used as a form of Jewelry ( ca.1400 ) . Classical Philippines [ edit ] See also : Cultural achievements of pre-colonial Philippines Mining in the Philippines began around 1000 BC . The early Filipinos worked various mines of gold , silver , copper and iron . Jewels , gold ingots , chains , calombigas and earrings were handed down from antiquity and inherited from their ancestors . Gold dagger handles , gold dishes , tooth plating , and huge gold ornaments were also used . [ 21 ] In Laszlo Legeza 's `` Tantric elements in pre-Hispanic Philippines Gold Art '' , he mentioned that gold jewelry of Philippine origin was found in Ancient Egypt . [ 21 ] According to Antonio Pigafetta , the people of Mindoro possessed great skill in mixing gold with other metals and gave it a natural and perfect appearance that could deceive even the best of silversmiths . [ 21 ] The natives were also known for the pieces of jewelry made of other precious stones such as carnelian , agate and pearl . Some outstanding examples of Philippine jewelry included necklaces , belts , armlets and rings placed around the waist . Americas [ edit ] Lead mining in the upper Mississippi River region of the U.S. , 1865 . During prehistoric times , large amounts of copper was mined along Lake Superior 's Keweenaw Peninsula and in nearby Isle Royale ; metallic copper was still present near the surface in colonial times . [ 22 ] [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Indigenous peoples used Lake Superior copper from at least 5,000 years ago ; [ 22 ] copper tools , arrowheads , and other artifacts that were part of an extensive native trade network have been discovered . In addition , obsidian , flint , and other minerals were mined , worked , and traded . [ 23 ] Early French explorers who encountered the sites [ clarification needed ] made no use of the metals due to the difficulties of transporting them , [ 23 ] but the copper was eventually traded throughout the continent along major river routes . Miners at the Tamarack Mine in Copper Country , Michigan , U.S. in 1905 . In the early colonial history of the Americas , `` native gold and silver was quickly expropriated and sent back to Spain in fleets of gold- and silver-laden galleons , '' [ 25 ] the gold and silver originating mostly from mines in Central and South America . Turquoise dated at 700 AD was mined in pre-Columbian America ; in the Cerillos Mining District in New Mexico , estimates are that `` about 15,000 tons of rock had been removed from Mt . Chalchihuitl using stone tools before 1700 . `` [ 26 ] [ 27 ] In 1727 , Louis Denys ( Denis ) ( 1675–1741 ) , sieur de La Ronde – brother of Simon-Pierre Denys de Bonaventure and the son-in-law of René Chartier – took command of Fort La Pointe at Chequamegon Bay ; where natives informed him of an island of copper . La Ronde obtained permission from the French crown to operate mines in 1733 , becoming `` the first practical miner on Lake Superior '' ; seven years later , mining was halted by an outbreak between Sioux and Chippewa tribes . [ 28 ] Mining in the United States became prevalent in the 19th century , and the General Mining Act of 1872 was passed to encourage mining of federal lands . [ 29 ] As with the California Gold Rush in the mid-19th century , mining for minerals and precious metals , along with ranching , was a driving factor in the Westward Expansion to the Pacific coast . With the exploration of the West , mining camps were established and `` expressed a distinctive spirit , an enduring legacy to the new nation ; '' Gold Rushers would experience the same problems as the Land Rushers of the transient West that preceded them . [ 30 ] Aided by railroads , many traveled West for work opportunities in mining . Western cities such as Denver and Sacramento originated as mining towns . When new areas were explored , it was usually the gold ( placer and then lode ) and then silver that were taken into possession and extracted first . Other metals would often wait for railroads or canals , as coarse gold dust and nuggets do not require smelting and are easy to identify and transport .

      " the gold and silver rush to the western United States also stimulated mining for coal as well as base metals such as copper , lead , and iron . Areas in modern Montana , Utah , Arizona , and later Alaska became predominate suppliers of copper to the world , which was increasingly demanding copper for electrical and households goods . [ 31 ] Canada 's mining industry grew more slowly than did the United States ' due to limitations in transportation , capital , and U.S. competition ; Ontario was the major producer of the early 20th century with nickel , copper , and gold . [ 31 ] Meanwhile , Australia experienced the Australian gold rushes and by the 1850s was producing 40 % of the world 's gold , followed by the establishment of large mines such as the Mount Morgan Mine , which ran for nearly a hundred years , Broken Hill ore deposit ( one of the largest zinc-lead ore deposits ) , and the iron ore mines at Iron Knob . After declines in production , another boom in mining occurred in the 1960s . Now , in the early 21st century , Australia remains a major world mineral producer . [ 32 ] As the 21st century begins , a globalized mining industry of large multinational corporations has arisen . Peak minerals and environmental impacts have also become a concern . Different elements , particularly rare earth minerals , have begun to increase in demand as a result of new technologies . Mine development and life cycle [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( July 2018 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) Schematic of a cut and fill mining operation in hard rock . The process of mining from discovery of an ore body through extraction of minerals and finally to returning the land to its natural state consists of several distinct steps . The first is discovery of the ore body , which is carried out through prospecting or exploration to find and then define the extent , location and value of the ore body . This leads to a mathematical resource estimation to estimate the size and grade of the deposit . This estimation is used to conduct a pre-feasibility study to determine the theoretical economics of the ore deposit . This identifies , early on , whether further investment in estimation and engineering studies is warranted and identifies key risks and areas for further work . The next step is to conduct a feasibility study to evaluate the financial viability , the technical and financial risks , and the robustness of the project . This is when the mining company makes the decision whether to develop the mine or to walk away from the project . This includes mine planning to evaluate the economically recoverable portion of the deposit , the metallurgy and ore recoverability , marketability and payability of the ore concentrates , engineering concerns , milling and infrastructure costs , finance and equity requirements , and an analysis of the proposed mine from the initial excavation all the way through to reclamation . The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area . To gain access to the mineral deposit within an area it is often necessary to mine through or remove waste material which is not of immediate interest to the miner . The total movement of ore and waste constitutes the mining process . Often more waste than ore is mined during the life of a mine , depending on the nature and location of the ore body . Waste removal and placement is a major cost to the mining operator , so a detailed characterization of the waste material forms an essential part of the geological exploration program for a mining operation . Once the analysis determines a given ore body is worth recovering , development begins to create access to the ore body . The mine buildings and processing plants are built , and any necessary equipment is obtained . The operation of the mine to recover the ore begins and continues as long as the company operating the mine finds it economical to do so . Once all the ore that the mine can produce profitably is recovered , reclamation begins to make the land used by the mine suitable for future use . Techniques [ edit ] Underground longwall mining . Mining techniques can be divided into two common excavation types : surface mining and sub-surface ( underground ) mining . Today , surface mining is much more common , and produces , for example , 85 % of minerals ( excluding petroleum and natural gas ) in the United States , including 98 % of metallic ores . [ 33 ] Targets are divided into two general categories of materials : placer deposits , consisting of valuable minerals contained within river gravels , beach sands , and other unconsolidated materials ; and lode deposits , where valuable minerals are found in veins , in layers , or in mineral grains generally distributed throughout a mass of actual rock . Both types of ore deposit , placer or lode , are mined by both surface and underground methods . Some mining , including much of the rare earth elements and uranium mining , is done by less-common methods , such as in-situ leaching : this technique involves digging neither at the surface nor underground . The extraction of target minerals by this technique requires that they be soluble , e.g. , potash , potassium chloride , sodium chloride , sodium sulfate , which dissolve in water . Some minerals , such as copper minerals and uranium oxide , require acid or carbonate solutions to dissolve . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Surface [ edit ] Main article : Surface mining Surface mining is done by removing ( stripping ) surface vegetation , dirt , and , if necessary , layers of bedrock in order to reach buried ore deposits . Techniques of surface mining include : open-pit mining , which is the recovery of materials from an open pit in the ground , quarrying , identical to open-pit mining except that it refers to sand , stone and clay ; [ 36 ] strip mining , which consists of stripping surface layers off to reveal ore/seams underneath ; and mountaintop removal , commonly associated with coal mining , which involves taking the top of a mountain off to reach ore deposits at depth . Most ( but not all ) placer deposits , because of their shallowly buried nature , are mined by surface methods . Finally , landfill mining involves sites where landfills are excavated and processed . [ 37 ] Landfill mining has been thought of as a solution to dealing with long-term methane emissions and local pollution . [ 38 ] Garzweiler surface mine , Germany High wall [ edit ] High wall mining is another form of surface mining that evolved from auger mining . In high wall mining , the coal seam is penetrated by a continuous miner propelled by a hydraulic Push-beam Transfer Mechanism ( PTM ) . A typical cycle includes sumping ( launch-pushing forward ) and shearing ( raising and lowering the cutter-head boom to cut the entire height of the coal seam ) . As the coal recovery cycle continues , the cutter-head is progressively launched into the coal seam for 19.72 feet ( 6.01 m ) . Then , the Push-beam Transfer Mechanism ( PTM ) automatically inserts a 19.72-foot ( 6.01 m ) long rectangular Push-beam ( Screw-Conveyor Segment ) into the center section of the machine between the Powerhead and the cutter-head . The Push-beam system can penetrate nearly 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) into the coal seam . One patented high wall mining system uses augers enclosed inside the Push-beam that prevent the mined coal from being contaminated by rock debris during the conveyance process . Using a video imaging and/or a gamma ray sensor and/or other Geo-Radar systems like a coal-rock interface detection sensor ( CID ) , the operator can see ahead projection of the seam-rock interface and guide the continuous miner 's progress . High wall mining can produce thousands of tons of coal in contour-strip operations with narrow benches , previously mined areas , trench mine applications and steep-dip seams with controlled water-inflow pump system and/or a gas ( inert ) venting system . Underground [ edit ] Main articles : Underground mining ( hard rock ) and Underground mining ( soft rock ) Mantrip used for transporting miners within an underground mine Sub-surface mining consists of digging tunnels or shafts into the earth to reach buried ore deposits . Ore , for processing , and waste rock , for disposal , are brought to the surface through the tunnels and shafts . Sub-surface mining can be classified by the type of access shafts used , and the extraction method or the technique used to reach the mineral deposit . Drift mining utilizes horizontal access tunnels , slope mining uses diagonally sloping access shafts , and shaft mining utilizes vertical access shafts . Mining in hard and soft rock formations require different techniques . Other methods include shrinkage stope mining , which is mining upward , creating a sloping underground room , long wall mining , which is grinding a long ore surface underground , and room and pillar mining , which is removing ore from rooms while leaving pillars in place to support the roof of the room . Room and pillar mining often leads to retreat mining , in which supporting pillars are removed as miners retreat , allowing the room to cave in , thereby loosening more ore. Additional sub-surface mining methods include hard rock mining , which is mining of hard rock ( igneous , metamorphic or sedimentary ) materials , bore hole mining , drift and fill mining , long hole slope mining , sub level caving , and block caving . Caterpillar Highwall Miner HW300 – Technology Bridging Underground and Open Pit Mining Machines [ edit ] The Bagger 288 is a bucket-wheel excavator used in strip mining . It is also one of the largest land vehicles of all time . A Bucyrus Erie 2570 dragline and CAT 797 haul truck at the North Antelope Rochelle opencut coal mine Heavy machinery is used in mining to explore and develop sites , to remove and stockpile overburden , to break and remove rocks of various hardness and toughness , to process the ore , and to carry out reclamation projects after the mine is closed . Bulldozers , drills , explosives and trucks are all necessary for excavating the land . In the case of placer mining , unconsolidated gravel , or alluvium , is fed into machinery consisting of a hopper and a shaking screen or trommel which frees the desired minerals from the waste gravel . The minerals are then concentrated using sluices or jigs . Large drills "
